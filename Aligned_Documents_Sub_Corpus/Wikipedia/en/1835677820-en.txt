Wirth's law in computing was made popular by Niklaus Wirth in 1995. There are two versions and it is unclear which was the original form, or where the belief actually originated. According to Wirth's law:Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster. Which Wirth attributed to Martin Reiser.orSoftware is decelerating faster than hardware is accelerating.Computer hardware has gotten faster over time, and some of that development is quantified by Moore's law; Wirth's law points out that this does not imply that work is actually getting done faster.An example can be found with the transition to and emergence of 64-bit architectures and multi-core CPUs for which applications and operating systems have been attributed as being complex and financially intensive to design and providing little benefit to current mainstream markets.See alsoKISS principleMoore's LawParkinson's lawSoftware bloatReferencesThe School of Niklaus Wirth: The Art of Simplicity by László Böszörményi, Jürg Gutknecht, and Gustav Pomberger (Editors), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000, ISBN 1-55860-723-4.Category:Adages Category:Computing culturede:Wirthsches Gesetz es:Ley de Wirth fr:Loi de Wirth he:חוק וירת nl:Wet van Wirth ja:ヴィルトの法則 pl:Prawo Wirtha
