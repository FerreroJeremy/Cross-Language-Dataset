ANNEX 
Annexes II and III to Directive 79/622/EEC are amended as follows: 
1. in Annex II, the following text is added in point 1.2.4: %quot%All components that the driver could himself remove shall be removed for the tests. If it is possible to keep the doors and windows open or to remove them when the tractor is in use, they must be kept open or removed during the tests, so as not to increase the strengh of the roll-over protection structure. If, in this position, they constitute a danger for the driver should the tractor roll over, the test report must refer to this fact.;%quot% 
2. Annex III is amended as follows: 
(a) the following text is added to the first subparagraph of point 1.3: %quot%In the case of a tractor with a reversible position, the load shall be applied to the upper extremity of the roll-over protection structure half-way between the two seat reference points.;%quot% 
(b) the following points 2.2.11, 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 are inserted: %quot%2.2.11. In the case of a tractor with a reversible driving position, the clearance shall be a combination of the two clearances determined for the two positions of the steering wheel and seat. 
2.2.12. In the case of a tractor which can be fitted with optional seats, the tests shall be based on the combined seat-reference-point clearance for all available seat options. The roll-over protection structure must not enter the combined clearance around the various seat reference points. 
2.2.13. Where a new seat option is proposed after the test has taken place, a calculation is made to determine whether the clearance around the new seat reference point is located entirely within the clearance previously established. If this is not the case, a new test is required.%quot%.
