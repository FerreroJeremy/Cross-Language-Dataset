Council Common Position 2006/276/CFSP of 10 April 2006 concerning restrictive measures against certain officials of Belarus and repealing Common Position 2004/661/CFSP 
Council Common Position 2006/276/CFSP 
of 10 April 2006 
concerning restrictive measures against certain officials of Belarus and repealing Common Position 2004/661/CFSP 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) On 24 September 2004, the Council adopted Common Position 2004/661/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against certain officials of Belarus [1] regarding certain officials of Belarus who are responsible for, but failed to start, the initiation of independent investigation and prosecution of the alleged crimes and those who are considered by the Pourgourides Report to be key actors in the disappearances of four well-known persons in Belarus in 1999/2000 and the following cover-up, in view of their apparent obstruction of justice. 
(2) On 13 December 2004, the Council adopted Common Position 2004/848/CFSP amending Common Position 2004/661/CFSP [2] in order to expand the scope of the restrictive measures to persons directly responsible for the fraudulent elections and referendum in Belarus on 17 October 2004 and those who are responsible for severe human rights violations in the repression of peaceful demonstrators in the aftermath of the elections and referendum in Belarus. 
(3) On 23 March 2006, the European Council condemned the action taken on that day by the Belarus authorities in arresting peaceful demonstrators exercising their legitimate right of free assembly to protest at the conduct of the presidential elections held in Belarus on 19 March 2006. The European Council deplored the failure of the Belarusian authorities to meet OSCE commitments to democratic elections and considers that the presidential elections were fundamentally flawed. 
(4) The European Council consequently decided that EU should adopt restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards, including President Lukashenko. 
(5) Restrictive measures should also be adopted against the Belarusian leadership and officials responsible for the violations of international electoral standards and the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition. 
(6) The restrictive measures imposed by Common Position 2004/661/CFSP and the additional restrictive measures should be consolidated in a single instrument. Common Position 2004/661/CFSP should therefore be repealed. 
(7) As regards the measures referred to in recital (1), the EU will review its position in the light of future developments, taking into account the willingness of the relevant Belarusian authorities to have the disappearances fully and transparently investigated and those responsible for the crimes brought to justice. 
(8) The restrictive measures against the persons who are directly responsible for the fraudulent elections and referendum in Belarus on 17 October 2004 and those who are responsible for severe human rights violations in the repression of peaceful demonstrators in the aftermath of the elections and referendum, should be reviewed in the light of reforms made to the Electoral Code to bring it into line with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections as recommended by the OSCE/ODIHR, and in the light of concrete actions by the authorities to respect human rights with regard to peaceful demonstrations. 
(9) The restrictive measures against the persons who are responsible for the violations of international electoral standards during the 19 March 2006 elections and for the crackdown on civil society in the context of these elections, should be reviewed with a view to the speedy release and rehabilitation of all political detainees, and in the light of reforms made to the Electoral Code to bring it into line with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections as recommended by the OSCE/ODIHR, the conduct of future elections and concrete actions by the authorities to respect democratic values, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and of the media, and the freedom of assembly and political association,
