Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 
of 27 December 2001 
on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60, 301 and 308 thereof, 
Having regard to Common Position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism(1), adopted by the Council on 27 December 2001, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Whereas: 
(1) At its extraordinary meeting on 21 September 2001, the European Council declared that terrorism is a real challenge to the world and to Europe and that the fight against terrorism will be a priority objective of the European Union. 
(2) The European Council declared that combating the funding of terrorism is a decisive aspect of the fight against terrorism and called upon the Council to take the necessary measures to combat any form of financing for terrorist activities. 
(3) In its Resolution 1373(2001), the United Nations Security Council decided on 28 September 2001 that all States should implement a freezing of funds and other financial assets or economic resources as against persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or who participate in or facilitate the commission of such acts. 
(4) In addition, the Security Council decided that measures should be taken to prohibit funds and other financial assets or economic resources from being made available for the benefit of such persons, and to prohibit financial or other related services from being rendered for the benefit of such persons. 
(5) Action by the Community is necessary in order to implement the CFSP aspects of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP. 
(6) This Regulation is a measure needed at Community level and complementary to administrative and judicial procedures regarding terrorist organisations in the European Union and third countries. 
(7) Community territory is deemed to encompass, for the purposes of this Regulation, all the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty. 
(8) With a view to protecting the interests of the Community, certain exceptions may be granted. 
(9) As regards the procedure for establishing and amending the list referred to in Article 2(3) of this Regulation, the Council should exercise the corresponding implementing powers itself in view of the specific means available to its members for that purpose. 
(10) Circumvention of this Regulation should be prevented by an adequate system of information and, where appropriate, remedial measures, including additional Community legislation. 
(11) The competent authorities of the Member States should, where necessary, be empowered to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. 
(12) Member States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 
(13) The Commission and the Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation. 
(14) The list referred to in Article 2(3) of this Regulation may include persons and entities linked or related to third countries as well as those who otherwise are the focus of the CFSP aspects of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP. For the adoption of provisions in this Regulation concerning the latter, the Treaty does not provide powers other than those under Article 308. 
(15) The European Community has already implemented UNSCR 1267(1999) and 1333(2000) by adopting Regulation (EC) No 467/2001(3) freezing the assets of certain persons and groups and therefore those persons and groups are not covered by this Regulation,
