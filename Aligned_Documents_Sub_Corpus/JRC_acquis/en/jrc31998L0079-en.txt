Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices 
DIRECTIVE 98/79/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3), 
(1) Whereas measures should be adopted for the smooth operation of the internal market; whereas the internal market is an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured; 
(2) Whereas the content and scope of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in force in the Member States with regard to the safety, health protection and performance, characteristics and authorisation procedures for in vitro diagnostic medical devices are different; whereas the existence of such disparities creates barriers to trade, and whereas the need to establish harmonised rules has been confirmed by a comparative survey of national legislations carried out on behalf of the Commission; 
(3) Whereas the harmonisation of national legislation is the only means of removing such barriers to free trade and of preventing new barriers from arising; whereas this objective cannot be achieved in a satisfactory manner by other means by the individual Member States; whereas this Directive lays down only such requirements as are necessary and sufficient to ensure, under the best safety conditions, free movement of the in vitro diagnostic medical devices to which it applies; 
(4) Whereas the harmonised provisions must be distinguished from measures adopted by the Member States to manage the funding of public health and sickness insurance schemes relating directly or indirectly to such devices; whereas, therefore, the harmonised provisions do not affect the ability of the Member States to implement such measures provided that they comply with Community law; 
(5) Whereas in vitro diagnostic medical devices should provide patients, users and third parties with a high level of health protection and attain the performance levels originally attributed to them by the manufacturer; whereas, therefore, maintenance or improvement of the level of health protection attained in the Member States is one of the main objectives of this Directive; 
(6) Whereas, in accordance with the principles set out in the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards (4), rules regarding the design, manufacture and packaging of relevant products must be confined to the provisions required to meet the essential requirements; whereas, because they are essential, such requirements should replace the corresponding national provisions; whereas the essential requirements, including requirements to minimise and reduce risks, should be applied with discretion, taking into account the technology and practice at the time of design and technical and economic considerations compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety; 
(7) Whereas the major part of medical devices are covered by Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of laws relating to active implantable medical devices (5) and Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices (6) with the exclusion of in vitro diagnostic medical devices; whereas this Directive seeks to extend the harmonisation to in vitro diagnostic medical devices and whereas, in the interest of uniform Community rules, this Directive is based largely on the provisions of the said two Directives; 
(8) Whereas instruments, apparatus, appliances, materials or other articles, including software, which are intended to be used for research purposes, without any medical objective, are not regarded as devices for performance evaluation; 
(9) Whereas, although internationally certified reference materials and materials used for external quality assessment schemes are not covered by this Directive, calibrators and control materials needed by the user to establish or verify performances of devices are in vitro diagnostic medical devices; 
(10) Whereas, having regard to the principle of subsidiarity, reagents which are produced within health-institution laboratories for use in that environment and are not subject to commercialtransactions are not covered by this Directive; 
(11) Whereas, however, devices that are manufactured and intended to be used in a professional and commercial context for purposes of medical analysis without being marketed are subject to this Directive; 
(12) Whereas mechanical laboratory equipment especially designed for in vitro diagnostic examinations falls within the scope of this Directive and whereas, therefore, in order to harmonise the relevant directives, Directive 98/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to machinery (7), should be appropriately amended to bring it into line with this Directive; 
(13) Whereas this Directive should include requirements regarding the design and manufacture of devices emitting ionizing radiation; whereas this Directive does not affect the application of Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation (8); 
(14) Whereas, since electromagnetic compatibility aspects form an integral part of the essential requirements of this Directive, Council Directive 89/336/EEC of 2 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility (9) does not apply; 
(15) Whereas, in order to ease the task of proving conformity with the essential requirements and to enable conformity to be verified, it is desirable to have harmonised standards in respect of the prevention of risks associated with the design, manufacture and packaging of medical devices; whereas such harmonised standards are drawn up by private-law bodies and should retain their status as non-mandatory texts; whereas, to this end, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) are recognised as the competent bodies for the adoption of harmonised standards in accordance with the general guidelines on cooperation between the Commission and those two bodies signed on 13 November 1984; 
(16) Whereas, for the purpose of this Directive, a harmonised standard is a technical specification (European standard of harmonisation document) adopted, on a mandate from the Commission, by CEN or Cenelec or by both of those bodies in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (10), and pursuant to the abovementioned general guidelines; 
(17) Whereas, by way of exception to the general principles, the drawing up of common technical specifications takes account of a current practice in some Member States whereby for selected devices mainly used for the evaluation of the safety of blood supply and of organ donation, such specifications are adopted by the public authorities; whereas it is appropriate that these particular specifications should be replaced by common technical specifications; whereas these common technical specifications can be used for performance evaluation and reevaluation; 
(18) Whereas scientific experts from various interested parties could be involved in the drafting of common technical specifications and in the examination of other specific or general questions; 
(19) Whereas manufacturing, as covered by this Directive, also includes the packaging of the medical device, insofar as such packaging is related to the safety and performance aspects of this device; 
(20) Whereas certain devices have a limited life owing to the decline in their performance over time, which is related, for example, to the deterioriation in their physical or chemical properties, including the sterility or integrity of the packaging; whereas the manufacturer should determine and indicate the period during which the device will perform as intended; whereas the labelling should indicate the date until which the device or one of its components can be used with complete safety; 
(21) Whereas, in Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives (11), the Council laid down harmonised conformity assessment procedures; whereas the details added to these modules are justified by the nature of the verification required for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and by the need for consistency with Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC; 
(22) Whereas it is necessary, essentially for the purpose of the conformity assessment procedures, to group in vitro diagnostic medical devices into two main product classes; whereas, since the large majority of such devices do not constitute a direct risk to patients and are used by competently trained professionals, and the results obtained can often be confirmed by other means, the conformity assessment procedures can be carried out, as a general rule, under the sole responsibility of the manufacturer; whereas, taking account of existing national regulations and of notifications received following the procedure laid down in Directive 98/34/EC, the intervention of notified bodies is needed only for defined devices, the correct performance of which is essential to medical practice and the failure of which can cause a serious risk to health; 
(23) Whereas, among the in vitro diagnostic medical devices for which intervention of a notified body is required, the groups of products used in blood transfusion and the prevention of AIDS and certain types of hepatitis require a conformity assessment guaranteeing, with a view to their design and manufacture, an optimum level of safety and reliability; 
(24) Whereas the list of in vitro diagnostic medical devices to be subjected to third-party conformity assessment needs updating, taking account of technological progress and of developments in the field of health protection; whereas such updating measures must be taken in line with procedure III(a) as laid down in Council Decision 87/373/EEC of 13 July 1987 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (12); 
(25) Whereas an agreement on a modus vivendi between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concerning the implementing measures for acts adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty was reached on 20 December 1994 (13); 
(26) Whereas medical devices should, as a general rule, bear the CE marking indicating their conformity with the provisions of this Directive to enable them to move freely within the Community and to be put into service in accordance with their intended purpose; 
(27) Whereas manufacturers will be able, when the intervention of a notified body is required, to choose from a list of bodies published by the Commission; whereas, although Member States do not have an obligation to designate such notified bodies, they must ensure that bodies designated as notified bodies comply with the assessment criteria laid down in this Directive; 
(28) Whereas the director and staff of the notified bodies should not, themselves or through an intermediary, have any interest in the establishments subject to assessment and verification which is likely to compromise their independence; 
(29) Whereas the competent authorities in charge of market surveillance should be able, particularly in emergencies, to contact the manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the Community, in order to take any protection measures that should prove necessary; whereas cooperation and exchange of information between Member States are necessary with a view to uniform application of this Directive, in particular for the purpose of market surveillance; whereas to that end it is necessary to establish and manage a database containing data on manufacturers and their authorised representatives, on devices placed on the market, on certificates issued, suspended or withdrawn, and on the vigilance procedure; whereas a system of adverse incident reporting (vigilance procedure) constitutes a useful tool for surveillance of the market, including the performance of new devices; whereas information obtained from the vigilance procedure as well as from external quality assessment schemes is useful for decision-making on classification of devices; 
(30) Whereas it is essential that manufacturers notify the competent authorities of the placing on the market of 'new products` with regard both to the technology used and the substances to be analysed or other parameters; whereas this is true in particular of high-density DNA probe devices (known as micro-chips) used in genetic screening; 
(31) Whereas, when a Member State considers that, as regards a given product or group of products, it is necessary, in order to protect health and safety and/or ensure compliance with the imperatives of public health, in accordance with Article 36 of the Treaty, to prohibit or restrict their availability or to subject it to special conditions, it may take any transitional measures that are necessary and justified; whereas, in such cases, the Commission consults the interested parties and the Member States and, if the national measures are justified, adopts the necessary Community measures, in accordance with procedure III(a) as laid down in Decision 87/373/EEC; 
(32) Whereas this Directive covers in vitro diagnostic medical devices manufactured from tissues, cells or substances of human origin; whereas it does not refer to the other medical devices manufactured using substances of human origin; whereas, therefore, work will have to continue in this connection in order to produce Community legislation as soon as possible; 
(33) Whereas, in view of the need to protect the integrity of the human person during the sampling, collection and use of substances derived from the human body, it is appropriate to apply the principles laid down in the Convention of the Council of Europe for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine; whereas, furthermore, national regulations relating to ethics continue to apply; 
(34) Whereas, in the interests of overall consistency between directives on medical devices, some of the provisions of this Directive should be incorporated into Directive 93/42/EEC, which needs to be amended accordingly; 
(35) Whereas it is necessary to draw up as quickly as possible the legislation which is lacking on medical devices manufactured using substances of human origin, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 Scope, definitions 
1. This Directive shall apply to in vitro diagnostic medical devices and their accessories. For the purposes of this Directive, accessories shall be treated as in vitro diagnostic medical devices in their own right. Both in vitro diagnostic medical devices and accessories shall hereinafter be termed devices. 
2. For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: 
(a) 'medical device` means any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including the software necessary for its proper application, intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of: 
- diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease, 
- diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation or compensation for an injury or handicap, 
- investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, 
- control of conception, 
and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means; 
(b) 'in vitro diagnostic medical device` means any medical device which is a reagent, reagent product, calibrator, control material, kit, instrument, apparatus, equipment, or system, whether used alone or in combination, intended by the manufacturer to be used in vitro for the examination of specimens, including blood and tissue donations, derived from the human body, solely or principally for the purpose of providing information: 
- concerning a physiological or pathological state, or 
- concerning a congenital abnormality, or 
- to determine the safety and compatibility with potential recipients, or 
- to monitor therapeutic measures. 
Specimen receptacles are considered to be in vitro diagnostic medical devices. 'Specimen receptacles` are those devices, whether vacuum-type or not, specifically intended by their manufacturers for the primary containment and preservation of specimens derived from the human body for the purpose of in vitro diagnostic examination. 
Products for general laboratory use are not in vitro diagnostic medical devices unless such products, in view of their characteristics, are specifically intended by their manufacturer to be used for in vitro diagnostic examination; 
(c) 'accessory` means an article which, whilst not being an in vitro diagnostic medical device, is intended specifically by its manufacturer to be used together with a device to enable that device to be used in accordance with its intended purpose. 
For the purposes of this definition, invasive sampling devices or those which are directly applied to the human body for the purpose of obtaining a specimen within the meaning of Directive 93/42/EEC shall not be considered to be accessories to in vitro diagnostic medical devices; 
(d) 'device for self-testing` means any device intended by the manufacturer to be able to be used by lay persons in a home environment; 
(e) 'device for performance evaluation` means any device intended by the manufacturer to be subject to one or more performance evaluation studies in laboratories for medical analyses or in other appropriate environments outside his own premises; 
(f) 'manufacturer` means the natural or legal person with responsibility for the design, manufacture, packaging and labelling of a device before it is placed on the market under his own name, regardless of whether these operations are carried out by that person himself or on his behalf by a third party. 
The obligations of this Directive to be met by manufacturers also apply to the natural or legal person who assembles, packages, processes, fully refurbishes and/or labels one or more ready-made products and/or assigns to them their intended purpose as devices with a view to their being placed on the market under his own name. This subparagraph does not apply to the person who, while not a manufacturer within the meaning of the first subparagraph, assembles or adapts devices already on the market to their intended purpose for an individual patient; 
(g) 'authorised representative` means any natural or legal person established in the Community who, explicitly designated by the manufacturer, acts and may be addressed by authorities and bodies in the Community instead of the manufacturer with regard to the latter's obligations under this Directive; 
(h) 'intended purpose` means the use for which the device is intended according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the labelling, in the instructions for use and/or in promotional materials; 
(i) 'placing on the market` means the first making available in return for payment or free of charge of a device other than a device intended for performance evaluation with a view to distribution and/or use on the Community market, regardless of whether it is new or fully refurbished; 
(j) 'putting into service` means the stage at which a device has been made available to the final user as being ready for use on the Community market for the first time for its intended purpose. 
3. For the purposes of this Directive, calibration and control materials refer to any substance, material or article intended by their manufacturer either to establish measurement relationships or to verify the performance characteristics of a device in conjunction with the intended use of that device. 
4. For the purposes of this Directive, the removal, collection and use of tissues, cells and substances of human origin shall be governed, in relation to ethics, by the principles laid down in the Convention of the Council of Europe for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine and by any Member States regulations on this matter. 
5. This Directive shall not apply to devices manufactured and used only within the same health institution and on the premises of their manufacture or used on premises in the immediate vicinity without having been transferred to another legal entity. This does not affect the right of Member State to subject such activities to appropriate protection requirements. 
6. This Directive shall not affect national laws which provide for the supply of devices by a medical prescription. 
7. This Directive is a specific directive within the meaning of Article 2(2) of Directive 89/336/EEC, which shall cease to apply to devices which have complied with this Directive. 
Article 2 Placing on the market and putting into service 
Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that devices may be placed on the market and/or put into service only if they comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive when duly supplied and properly installed, maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose. This involves the obligation of Member States to monitor the security and quality of these devices. This Article applies also to devices made available for performance evaluation. 
Article 3 Essential requirements 
Devices must meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I which apply to them, taking account of the intended purpose of the devices concerned. 
Article 4 Free movement 
1. Member States shall not create any obstacle to the placing on the market or the putting into service within their territory of devices bearing the CE marking provided for in Article 16 if these devices have undergone conformity assessment in accordance with Article 9. 
2. Member States shall not create any obstacle to devices intended for performance evaluation being made available for that purpose to the laboratories or other institutions listed in the statement referred to in Annex VIII if they meet the conditions laid down in Article 9(4) and Annex VIII. 
3. At trade fairs, exhibitions, demonstrations, scientific or technical gatherings, etc. Member States shall not create any obstacle to the showing of devices which do not conform to this Directive, provided that such devices are not used on specimens taken from the participants and that a visible sign clearly indicates that such devices cannot be marketed or put into service until they have been made to comply. 
4. Member States may require the information to be supplied pursuant to Annex I, part B, section 8 to be in their official language(s) when a device reaches the final user. 
Provided that safe and correct use of the device is ensured, Member States may authorise the information referred to in the first subparagraph to be in one or more other official Community language(s). 
In the application of this provision, Member States shall take into account the principle of proportionality and, in particular: 
(a) whether the information can be supplied by harmonised symbols or recognised codes or other measures; 
(b) the type of user anticipated for the device. 
5. Where the devices are subject to other directives concerning other aspects which also provide for the affixing of the CE marking, the latter shall indicate that the devices also fulfil the provisions of the other directives. 
However, should one or more of these directives allow the manufacturer, during a transitional period, to choose which arrangements to apply, the CE marking shall indicate that the devices fulfil the provisions only of those directives applied by the manufacturer. In this case, the particulars of these directives, as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, must be given in the documents, notices or instructions required by the directives and accompanying such devices. 
Article 5 Reference to standards 
1. Member States shall presume compliance with the essential requirements referred to in Article 3 in respect of devices which are in conformity with the relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities; Member States shall publish the reference numbers of such national standards. 
2. If a Member State or the Commission considers that the harmonised standards do not entirely meet the essential requirements referred to in Article 3, the measures to be taken by the Member States with regard to these standards and the publication referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted by the procedure defined in Article 6(2). 
3. Member States shall presume compliance with the essential requirements referred to in Article 3 in respect of devices designed and manufactured in conformity with common technical specifications drawn up for the devices in List A of Annex II and, where necessary, the devices in List B of Annex II. These specifications shall establish appropriate performance evaluation and re-evaluation criteria, batch release criteria, reference methods and reference materials. 
The common technical specifications shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure mentioned in Article 7(2) and be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. 
Manufacturers shall as a general rule be required to comply with the common technical specifications; if for duly justified reasons manufacturers do not comply with those specifications they must adopt solutions of a level at least equivalent thereto. 
Where, in this Directive, reference is made to harmonised standards, this is also meant to refer to the common technical specifications. 
Article 6 Committee on Standards and Technical Regulations 
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. 
2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter, if necessary by taking a vote. 
The opinion shall be recorded in the minutes; in addition, each Member State shall have the right to ask to have its position recorded in the minutes. 
The Commission shall take the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the committee. It shall inform the committee of the manner in which its opinion has been taken into account. 
Article 7 Committee on Medical Devices 
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the committee set up by Article 6(2) of Directive 90/385/EEC. 
2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148(2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote. 
The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee. 
If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority. 
If, on the expiry of a period of three months from the date of referral to the Council, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission. 
3. The committee referred to in paragraph 1 may examine any question connected with the implementation of this Directive. 
Article 8 Safeguard clause 
1. Where a Member State ascertains that the devices referred to in Article 4(1), when correctly installed, maintained and used for their intended purpose may compromise the health and/or safety of patients, users or, where applicable, other persons, or the safety of property, it shall take all appropriate interim measures to withdraw such devices from the market or prohibit or restrict their being placed on the market or put into service. The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission of any such measures, indicating the reasons for its decision and, in particular, whether non-compliance with this Directive is due to: 
(a) failure to meet the essential requirements referred to in Article 3; 
(b) incorrect application of the standards referred to in Article 5, insofar as it is claimed that the standards have been applied; 
(c) shortcomings in the standards themselves. 
2. The Commission shall enter into consultation with the parties concerned as soon as possible. Where, after such consultation, the Commission finds that: 
- the measures are justified, it shall immediately so inform the Member State which took the initiative and the other Member States; where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 is attributed to shortcomings in the standards, the Commission shall, after consulting the parties concerned, bring the matter before the committee referred to in Article 6(1) within two months if the Member State which has taken the decision intends to maintain it and shall initiate the procedures referred to in Article 6; where the measure referred to in paragraph 1 is attributed to problems related to the contents or to the application of the common technical specifications, the Commission shall, after consulting the parties concerned, bring the matter before the Committee referred to in Article 7(1) within two months, 
- the measures are unjustified, it shall immediately so inform the Member State which took the initiative and the manufacturer or his authorised representative. 
3. Where a non-complying device bears the CE marking, the competent Member State shall take appropriate action against whomsoever affixed the marking and shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof. 
4. The Commission shall ensure that the Member States are kept informed of the progress and outcome of this procedure. 
Article 9 Conformity assessment procedures 
1. For all devices other than those covered by Annex II and devices for performance evaluation, the manufacturer shall, in order to affix the CE marking, follow the procedure referred to in Annex III and draw up the EC declaration of conformity required before placing the devices on the market. 
For all devices for self-testing other than those covered by Annex II and devices for performance evaluation, the manufacturer shall, prior to the drawing up of the aforementioned declaration of conformity, fulfil the supplementary requirements set out in Annex III, point 6. Instead of applying this procedure, the manufacturer may follow the procedure referred to in paragraphs 2 or 3. 
2. For all devices referred to in List A in Annex II other than those intended for performance evaluation, the manufacturer shall, in order to affix the CE marking either: 
(a) follow the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex IV (full quality assurance), or 
(b) follow the procedure relating to EC type-examination set out in Annex V coupled with the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex VII (production quality assurance). 
3. For all devices referred to in List B in Annex II other than those intended for performance evaluation, the manufacturer shall for the purposes of affixing the CE marking, follow either: 
(a) the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex IV (full quality assurance) or 
(b) the procedure relating to EC type-examination set out in Annex V couplet with: 
(i) the procedure relating to EC verification set out in Annex VI, or 
(ii) the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex VII (production quality assurance). 
4. In the case of devices for performance evaluation, the manufacturer shall follow the procedure referred to in Annex VIII and draw up the statement set out in that Annex before such devices are made available. 
This provision does not affect national regulations relating to the ethical aspects of carrying out performance evaluation studies using tissues or substances of human origin. 
5. During the conformity assessment procedure for a device, the manufacturer and, if involved, the notified body shall take account of the results of any assessment and verification operations which, where appropriate, have been carried out in accordance with this Directive at an intermediate state of manufacture. 
6. The manufacturer may instruct his authorised representative to initiate the procedures provided for in Annexes III, V, VI and VIII. 
7. The manufacturer must keep the declaration of conformity, the technical documentation referred to in Annexes III to VIII, as well as the decisions, reports and certificates, established by notified bodies, and make it available to the national authorities for inspection purposes for a period ending five years after the last product has been manufactured. Where the manufacturer is not established in the Community, the obligation to make the aforementioned documentation available on request applies to his authorised representative. 
8. Where the conformity assessment procedure involves intervention of a notified body, the manufacturer, or authorised representative, may apply to a body of his choice within the framework of tasks for which the body has been notified. 
9. The notified body may require, where duly justified, any information or data, which is necessary for establishing and maintaining the attestation of conformity in view of the chosen procedure. 
10. Decisions taken by the notified bodies in accordance with Annexes III, IV, and V shall be valid for a maximum of five years and may be extended on application, made at a time agreed in the contract signed by both parties, for further periods of up to five years. 
11. The records and correspondence relating to the procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be in an official language of the Member State in which the procedures are carried out and/or in another Community language acceptable to the notified body. 
12. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 to 4, the competent authorities may authorise, on duly justified request, the placing on the market and putting into service, within the territory of the Member State concerned, of individual devices for which the procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 have not been carried out and the use of which is in the interest of protection of health. 
13. The provisions of this Article shall apply accordingly to any natural or legal person who manufacturers devices covered by this Directive and, without placing them on the market, puts them into service and uses them in the context of his professional activity. 
Article 10 Registration of manufacturers and devices 
1. Any manufacturer who places devices on the market under his own name shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State in which he has his registered place of business: 
- of the address of the registered place of business, 
- of information relating to the reagents, reagent products and calibration and control materials in terms of common technological characteristics and/or analytes and of any significant change thereto including discontinuation of placing on the market; for other devices, the appropriate indications, 
- in the case of devices covered by Annex II and of devices for self-testing, of all data allowing for identification of such devices, the analytical and, where appropriate, diagnostic parameters as referred to in Annex I, part A, section 3, the outcome of performance evaluation pursuant to Annex VIII, certificates and any significant change thereto, including discontinuation of placing on the market. 
2. For devices covered by Annex II and for devices for self-testing, Member States may request to be informed of the data allowing identification together with the label and the instructions for use when such devices are placed on the market and/or put into service within their territory. 
These measures cannot constitute a precondition for the placing on the market and/or putting into service of devices which are in conformity with this Directive. 
3. Where a manufacturer who places devices on the market under his own name does not have a registered place of business in a Member State, he shall designate an authorised representative. The authorised representative shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State in which he has his registered place of business of all particulars as referred to in paragraph 1. 
4. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall also include any new device. In addition, where, in the context of such notification, a device notified, bearing the CE marking, is a 'new product`, the manufacturer shall indicate this fact on his notification. 
For the purposes of this Article, a device is 'new` if: 
(a) there has been no such device continuously available on the Community market during the previous three years for the relevant analyte or other parameter; 
(b) the procedure involves analytical technology not continuously used in connection with a given analyte or other parameter on the Community market during the previous three years. 
5. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the notifications referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 are registered immediately in the databank described in Article 12. The procedures for implementing this Article and in particular those referring to the notification and the concept of significant change shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7. 
6. Transitionally, pending the establishment of a European databank accessible to the competent authorities of the Member States and containing the data relating to all devices available on the territory of the Community, the manufacturer shall give such notification to the competent authorities of each Member State concerned by the placing on the market. 
Article 11 Vigilance procedure 
1. Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that any information brought to their knowledge, in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, regarding the incidents mentioned below involving devices bearing the CE marking is recorded and evaluated centrally: 
(a) any malfunction, failure or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labelling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health;

ANNEX VIII 
STATEMENT AND PROCEDURES CONCERNING DEVICES FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
1. For devices for performance evaluation the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall draw up the statement containing the information stipulated in section 2 and ensure that the relevant provisions of this Directive are met. 
2. The statement shall contain the following information: 
- data allowing identification of the device in question, 
- an evaluation plan stating in particular the purpose, scientific, technical or medical grounds, scope of the evaluation and number of devices concerned, 
- the list of laboratories or other institutions taking part in the evaluation study, 
- the starting date and scheduled duration for the evaluations and, in the case of devices for self-testing, the location and number of lay persons involved, 
- a statement that the device in question conforms to the requirements of the Directive, apart from the aspects covered by the evaluation and apart from those specifically itemised in the statement, and that every precaution has been taken to protect the health and safety of the patient, user and other persons. 
3. The manufacturer shall also undertake to keep available for the competent national authorities the documentation allowing an understanding of the design, manufacture and performances of the product, including the expected performances, so as to allow assessment of conformity with the requirements of this Directive. This documentation must be kept for a period ending at least five years after the end of the performance evaluation. 
The manufacturer shall take all the measures necessary for the manufacturing process to ensure that the products manufactured conform to the documentation mentioned in the first paragraph. 
4. The provisions of Article 10(1), (3) and (5) shall apply to devices intended for performance evaluation. 
ANNEX IX 
CRITERIA FOR THE DESIGNATION OF NOTIFIED BODIES 
1. The notified body, its director and the assessment and verification staff shall not be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, installer or user of the devices which they inspect, nor the authorised representative of any of these persons. They may not be directly involved in the design, construction, marketing or maintenance of the devices, nor represent the parties engaged in these activities. This in no way precludes the possibility of exchanges of technical information between the manufacturer and the body. 
2. The notified body and its staff must carry out the assessment and verification operations with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite competence in the field of medical devices and must be free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which might influence their judgment or the results of the inspection, especially from persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of the verifications. 
Should the notified body subcontract specific tasks connected with the establishment and verification of the facts, it must first ensure that the subcontractor meets the provisions of the Directive. The notified body shall keep at the disposal of the national authorities the relevant documents assessing the subcontractor's qualifications and the work carried out by the subcontractor under this Directive. 
3. The notified body must be able to carry out all the tasks assigned to such bodies by one of Annexes III to VII and for which it has been notified, whether these tasks are carried out by the body itself or on its responsibility. In particular, it must have the necessary staff and possess the facilities needed to perform properly the technical and administrative tasks entailed in assessment and verification. This includes the availability of sufficient scientific staff within the organisation who possess adequate experience and knowledge necessary to assess the biological and medical functionality and performance of devices for which it has been notified, in relation to the requirements of this Directive and, in particular, with Annex I requirements. The notified body must also have access to the equipment necessary for the verifications required. 
4. The inspection staff must have: 
- sound vocational training covering all the assessment and verification operations for which the body has been designated, 
- satisfactory knowledge of the rules on the inspections which they carry out and adequate experience of such inspections, 
- the ability required to draw up the certificates, records and reports to demonstrate that the inspections have been carried out. 
5. The impartiality of the inspection staff must be guaranteed. Their remuneration must not depend on the number of inspections carried out, nor on the results of the inspections. 
6. The body must take out civil liability insurance, unless liability is assumed by the State under domestic legislation or the Member State itself carries out the inspections directly. 
7. The staff of the inspection body are bound to observe professional secrecy with regard to all information gained in the course of their duties (except vis-Ă -vis the competent administrative authorities of the State in which their activities are carried out) under this Directive or any provision of national law putting it into effect. 
ANNEX X 
CE MARKING OF CONFORMITY 
The CE conformity marking shall consist of the initials 'CE` taking the following form: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
- If the marking is reduced or enlarged the proportions given in the above graduated drawing must be respected, 
- the various components of the CE marking must have substantially the same vertical dimension, which may not be less than 5 mm. This minimum dimension may be waived for small-scale devices.
