Commission Regulation (EC) No 908/2000 
of 2 May 2000 
laying down detailed rules for calculating aid granted by Member States to producer organisations in the fisheries and aquaculture sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector(1), and in particular Article 15(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 lays down the general conditions for granting and financing aid from the Member States to producer organisations recognised under Article 4 and, where appropriate, specifically recognised under Article 7a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3318/94(3). 
(2) To ensure that such aids are granted and financed under identical conditions, detailed rules should be laid down for calculating the value of the production marketed by producer organisations and the administrative expenses of such organisations and such calculations should be done on the basis of supporting accounting documents. In view of the difficulty of obtaining such documents in some cases, however, a flat-rate method should be available by way of an alternative. 
(3) The aid for which an association of producer organisations may qualify should be limited to a maximum overall amount, given that each of the member organisations may qualify for foundation and operating aid. 
(4) Detailed rules should be laid down defining expenses in connection with the implementation of a quality improvement plan by a producer organisation. 
(5) Detailed rules should be laid down governing the reimbursement of the Community contribution towards aid granted by Member States before 1 January 2000 but for which reimbursement was not the subject of a Commission decision before that date. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,
