THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 41 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 [1], and in particular Article 110 and Article 145(c), (d), (e) and (f) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Titles IV and IVa of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establish certain support schemes for farmers. The implementing rules of some of these schemes have already been laid down by the following acts: Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1686/72 of 2 August 1972 on certain detailed rules for aid for seed [2], Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1445/76 of 22 June 1976 specifying the different varieties of Lolium perenne L. [3], Commission Regulation (EC) No 1644/96 of 30 July 1996 laying down detailed rules for the grant of aid for certain grain legumes [4], Commission Regulation (EC) No 609/1999 of 19 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for granting aid to hop producers [5]; Commission Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999 of 22 October 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops [6], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 of 28 October 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal as regards premium schemes [7], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 of 19 November 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 as regards the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials [8], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2550/2001 of 21 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat as regards premium schemes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 [9], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2199/2003 of 16 December 2003 laying down transitional measures for the application in respect of the year 2004 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 as regards the single area payment scheme for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia [10], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2237/2003 of 23 December 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of the support schemes provided for in Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers [11]. In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to repeal those acts and replace them by one Regulation laying down the implementing rules for all those schemes, applicable from 1 January 2005. 
(2) In order to ensure the efficient administration of those schemes, the area payments should be restricted to certain areas and conditions should be specified. 
(3) Malta has a very large number of small farms, less than 0.3 hectare in size. To avoid many farmers in Malta being disqualified from the area based direct payments, the minimum size of application to area based direct payments in Malta should be fixed at 0.1 ha and, for the years 2005 and 2006, Malta should be allowed to derogate from Article 107(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
(4) The sowing of land for the sole purpose of qualifying for area payments should be prevented. Certain conditions relating to the sowing and cultivation of crops should be specified, in particular as regards durum wheat, protein plants and rice. Local standards should be respected in order to reflect the diversity of agricultural practice within the Community. 
(5) Only one application for an area payment should be permitted in respect of any parcel cultivated in a given year except in cases where the area payment is given as a supplement to the same crop or the aid concerns the production of seeds. Area payments may be granted on crops subsidised under a scheme falling within the Community's structural or environmental policies. 
(6) Supports schemes based on area aid provide that where the area for which aid is claimed exceeds the maximum guaranteed area or base areas or sub-base areas, the area per farmer for which aid is claimed is to be reduced proportionately in that year. It is therefore appropriate to establish the modalities and deadlines for the exchange of information between the Commission and the Member States in order to establish the coefficient of reduction and to inform the Commission of the areas for which the aid has been paid. The same provisions should apply for the reduction of the total amount of individual reference quantities in the event of application of Article 95(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
(7) Under Article 73 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the granting of the specific quality premium for durum wheat is subject to the use of certain quantities of certified seeds of varieties recognised, in the production zone, as being of high quality for the production of semolina or pasta. In order to ensure that those requirements are respected, the criteria for the variety screening method in each Member State should be fixed and the procedure for the establishment of the eligible varieties list as well as the minimum quantity of certified seeds to be used should be fixed. 
(8) The short time between the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and the entry into force of the specific quality premium for durum wheat makes it impossible to establish a list of eligible varieties for the granting of the aid in the year 2005 according to the envisaged screening method. It is therefore necessary for Member States to establish a transitional list based on a selection of current varieties. 
(9) In some regions, the protein crops are traditionally sown in a mixture with cereals for agronomical reasons. The resulting crop principally consists of protein crops. For the purpose of granting the protein crop premium, the areas thus sown should therefore be considered as areas of protein crops. 
(10) Standards for sweet lupins and tests to determine whether or not a sample of lupins is sweet should be laid down. 
(11) In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme for nuts, the area aid granted should not be used to finance marginal plantations or isolated trees. A minimum plot size and a minimum tree density of a specialised orchard should therefore be defined. In order to facilitate the transition between the existing improvement plans which expire later than the introduction of the new aid scheme, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures. 
(12) The terms of payment as well as the crop specific payment for rice calculation depend not only on the base area or areas fixed for each producing Member State fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, but also on the possible subdivision of those base areas into sub-base areas and on the objective criteria chosen by each Member State to perform this subdivision, on conditions in which the cultivated parcels are put into cultivation and on the minimum size of the base areas. As a consequence, detailed rules should be laid down for the establishment, the management and the cultivation modalities applicable to base areas and sub-base areas. 
(13) The observation of a possible overrun of the base area referred to in Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 implies a reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice. In order to set the calculation modalities for such a reduction, the criteria to be taken into consideration as well as applicable coefficients should be defined. 
(14) The follow-up of the payments of the crop specific payment for rice presumes that the Commission has been forwarded certain information related to the cultivation of base areas and sub-base areas. For that purpose, the detailed information that the Member States should communicate to the Commission as well as the deadlines for such communications should be determined. 
(15) Articles 93 and 94 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for an aid to farmers producing potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch subject to a cultivation contract and within the quota limit established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 of 27 July 1994 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch [12]. The conditions for the granting of the aid should therefore be established and, where applicable, cross references should be made to the existing provisions concerning the quota system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. 
(16) Articles 95 and 96 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide that the dairy premium and additional payment are paid to producers. Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector [13] provides for specific provisions in case of inactivity. It is therefore appropriate to provide, when a natural or legal person holding an individual reference quantity no longer meets the conditions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 during the twelve-month period preceding 31 March of the year concerned, for an exclusion from the benefit of the premium and payment. 
(17) Articles 88 to 92 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for a new aid scheme for energy crops to be granted to farmers. In line with Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999, which excludes sugarbeet from the aid, the cultivation of sugarbeet should be excluded from the aid scheme for energy crops. 
(18) The terms of eligibility for that aid should be laid down. For that purpose, it should be laid down that a contract must be concluded between the producer and the first processor with respect to the agricultural raw materials concerned. The conditions where processing is carried out by the farmer on the holding should also be defined. 
(19) To ensure that the raw material is processed into the specified energy product, first processors should lodge a security, despite the fact that the aid is granted not to first processors but to farmers. The security should be high enough to prevent any risk that the raw materials are ultimately diverted from their destination. In addition, in order to make the control system for the scheme effective, sales of raw materials and of semi-processed products should be limited to a maximum of two before final processing. 
(20) An explicit distinction should be made between the applicant's obligations, which end once the total quantity of raw material harvested is delivered, and the obligations incumbent on first processors, which commence on delivery and end with the final processing of the raw materials into energy products. 
(21) Certain transport operations within Community territory involving raw materials and products derived therefrom should be subject to controls entailing the use of T5 control copies to be issued in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code [14]. Provision should be made for alternative evidence should the T5 control copy be lost as a result of circumstances for which the first processor is not responsible. 
(22) Article 98 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for a reduction of the specific regional aid for arable crops when the total amount of aid claimed exceeds the fixed ceiling. The modalities for the calculation of the reduction coefficient should therefore be established. 
(23) Article 99 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility of direct aid being granted for the production of one or more seed species. 
(24) That aid may be granted only for the production of basic seed or certified seed and these products should be clearly defined by reference to the Directives on certification and marketing of seeds: Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed [15], Council Directive 66/402/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed [16], and Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants [17]. 
(25) To make controls possible, basic seed and certified seed should be produced under growing contracts or growing declarations which will be joined to the single application and seed establishments and breeders should be officially approved or registered. The necessary measures should be laid down for cases where a seed establishment or a breeder from one Member State grows seed in another Member State. 
(26) For administrative reasons, aid should, in each Member State, be granted only in respect of products harvested on the territory of that Member State. 
(27) Under Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, production aid is payable for basic and certified seed of varieties of Cannabis sativa L. with a tetrahydrocannabinol content not exceeding 0.2 %. In order to ensure uniform application throughout the Community of the rules for granting the aid, the list of the varieties of Cannabis sativa L. eligible for aid set up in Annex II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers [18] should be used for that purpose. 
(28) Article 108 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 defines the land that is eligible for arable crops area payments. That Article authorises certain exceptions under the control of the Member States which do not undermine the effectiveness of the arrangements laid down in that Regulation. In order to avoid any such risk, suitable measures should be laid down to keep the total area of eligible land at the current level and to prevent any appreciable increase therein. Those measures may in certain cases involve deeming previously eligible areas ineligible as an offsetting measure. 
(29) Member States where maize is not a traditional crop may make silage grass eligible for the arable crops area payments. Accordingly, it is necessary to define what is meant by silage grass. 
(30) Article 106 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 subjects the area payment for flax and hemp grown for fibre to the conclusion of a contract or to a commitment as referred to in Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre [19]. Provision should be made for a copy of the contract or the commitment to be sent to the competent authorities of the Member State responsible for the administration of payment applications. It should also be ensured that the varieties of flax and hemp grown for fibre are those listed in the Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species as fibre plants and, in the case of flax in particular, as "fibre flax" Moreover, in the case of hemp, the tetrahydrocannabinol content of the authorised varieties may not exceed 0.2 %. A list of eligible varieties for flax should therefore be drawn up, the eligible varieties for hemp being listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 796/2004. To provide firmer guarantees in the case of hemp, the use of certified seed should also be required. 
(31) Article 109 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 requires producers of cereals, oilseeds and protein plants to complete sowing by 31 May at the latest. In certain cases, sowing may be put off until after 31 May because of the climate. The deadline for sowing and for submitting applications should be extended for certain crops in certain regions. However, such extensions should not adversely affect the effectiveness of the support system or undermine the control system introduced by Chapter 4 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
(32) In order to ensure that the processing industry receives regular supplies of sweetcorn throughout the marketing year, producers should be able to spread their sowings over a longer period. The final date for sowing sweetcorn should therefore be deferred to 15 June. 
(33) It is appropriate to provide that a minimum quantity of certified durum wheat seed is to be used in the case of the durum wheat supplement and special aid. In view of the diversity of agricultural practice within the Member States and within regions thereof, the setting of the minimum quantity should be left to the Member States concerned. 
(34) For the purpose of Article 103 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, what is meant by irrigation should be defined. 
(35) The areas to be taken into account with a view to assessing any overshoot in the base area and the rules for determining the extent of such overshoots should be specified. Where a separate base area is established for maize, irrigated areas or silage grass, special rules should be laid down as regards the areas to be taken into account with a view to calculating any overshoot in the base area in question. The rules for determining any overshoot in the base area should ensure that the base area is complied with in all cases. The way the overshoot is to be calculated in respect of the maximum guaranteed areas for durum wheat should also be specified. The procedure to be followed for establishing overshoot of the ceiling of the payments referred to in Article 102(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should also be specified. 
(36) In the event of application of Article 71 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, eligibility for arable crops area payments is conditional on an obligation on the producers concerned to set aside part of the area on their holdings. Detailed implementing rules capable of ensuring that the scheme has the necessary effectiveness should be laid down. To that end, provision should be made for the areas counting as set-aside to be comparable with those counting for the purposes of calculating the regional base area. The legume crops referred to in the second indent of Article 107(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be defined. 
(37) Under Article 107(6) and in the event of application of Article 66 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, detailed rules should be established regarding land voluntarily set-aside. Those rules should be consistent with the overall system introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
(38) The criteria for eligibility for sheep and goat premiums provided for in Chapter 11 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, and in particular the conditions required, need to be laid down. 
(39) Article 113(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the granting of a premium to goatmeat farmers in certain areas of the Community. The areas in question should therefore be determined in accordance with the criteria laid down in that provision. 
(40) Under Article 114(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 farmers whose holdings have at least 50 % of their area used for agriculture situated in less-favoured areas may qualify for a supplementary premium. Article 113(2) makes reference to the specific geographical zones where goatmeat farmers meet the necessary conditions to qualify for the goat premium. Provisions should be made for a declaration to be provided by farmers meeting those criteria to prove that at least half of the land they are using for agricultural production is located in less-favoured areas or in areas which qualify for the goat premium. 
(41) For the purpose of control on eligibility for the correct level of ewe premium, Member States should draw up an inventory of farmers marketing sheep's milk or sheep's milk products. 
(42) With a view to implementing the system of individual limits as introduced by Articles 116, 117 and 118 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the existing administrative rules may continue to be applied as regards, in particular, the use of rights granted free of charge, the use of normal rights including minimum use, the temporary leasing and transfer of rights, the notification of changes on individual ceiling and the transfer of rights through the national reserve. Some of those rules are specific provisions for exceptional and duly justified circumstances such as, regarding the use of rights, the small farmers and farmers participating in extensification programs and early retirement schemes, and, for the transfer purpose, the inheritance of premiums rights and the case of farmers using only publicly or collectively owned land for grazing. 
(43) The Commission is to monitor the new arrangements and as a result it needs to be properly provided by the Member States with the essential information regarding the implementation of the premium rules. 
(44) If applicable, detailed information on the national rules on, and the implementation of, the additional payments should be forwarded to the Commission. 
(45) Title IV Chapter 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for beef and veal payments. The criteria for eligibility, and in particular the conditions required for those payments, need to be laid down. 
(46) The objectives of the regional ceiling and of the stocking density dictate that the special premium may no longer be applied for in respect of the same age bracket for those animals affected by the application of these two measures. For the purposes of the deseasonalisation premium, those animals should be deemed to have qualified for the special premium. 
(47) Provision should be made for the administrative document laid down in Article 123(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to be drawn up and issued at national level. In order to take account of particular administrative and control conditions in the Member States, different forms of administrative document should be allowed. 
(48) Article 123(3)(a) and Article 130(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 lay down a retention period as a condition for granting the special premium and the slaughter premium. It is therefore necessary to define and quantify that period. 
(49) The arrangements for granting the special premium at the time of slaughter should be consistent with the arrangements for granting the slaughter premium. The types of documents which are to accompany the animal until slaughter dispatch or export should be specified. In order to take account of the specific features of the form of granting at the time of slaughter, the age conditions for steers and the method of presentation of the carcase for adult bovine animals should be laid down. 
(50) The conditions for granting the deseasonalisation premium should be laid down, in accordance with the arrangements for granting the slaughter premium. The Commission should determine, on the basis of available information, which Member States meet the conditions for applying this premium scheme. 
(51) The concept of suckler cow laid down in Article 125 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be defined. In that respect, the same breeds should be kept as those under Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999. Moreover, the existing essential requirements may continue to be applied, in particular as regards the average milk yield and the additional national premium. 
(52) The existing administrative rules may continue to be applied as regards in particular the individual ceilings, the notifications on the individual ceilings and the national reserve, the rights obtained free of charge, the use of rights, the transfer and temporary leasing of rights, the transfers through the national reserve. 
(53) The Commission should determine, on the basis of available information, which Member States meet the conditions for applying the special scheme laid down in Article 129 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. The special arrangements for granting the premium should be specified. 
(54) The method for calculating the stocking density should be determined. A date should be laid down for taking the milk reference quantity into consideration. 
(55) The stocking density for the extensification payment scheme should include all bovine animals aged six months and over present on the holding. Special rules are therefore required for counting animals and for the producer's statement of participation in the scheme. Provision should be made for using the computerised database referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 [20]. 
(56) Steps should be taken to ensure that the extensification payment is not granted to farmers who artificially comply with the average stocking rates required for the grant of the extensification payment. 
(57) The procedures for determining, on the basis of available information, which Member States meet the conditions in Article 132(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for granting the extensification payment to dairy cows should be laid down. The special arrangements for granting the premium should be specified. A minimum retention period should be laid down. 
(58) Specific provisions should be laid down as regards the application of the rules on periods, dates and time limits to the retention period. 
(59) In the interests of simplification, the "livestock" aid application provided for in the integrated system should be taken to represent application for the slaughter premium, provided that it contains all the elements needed to justify payment of the premium and that the animal is slaughtered in the same Member State or in another Member State, or exported. 
(60) It should be possible to use the computerised database referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 to facilitate the management of the slaughter premium, on condition that the Member State concerned considers that the database offers adequate assurances as to the accuracy of the data it contains for the purposes of the payment of premiums. 
(61) The slaughter premium for calves is conditional on a maximum weight limit. A standard type of carcase presentation should therefore be laid down, to which this maximum weight applies. 
(62) Detailed information on the national rules on and implementation of the additional payments should be forwarded to the Commission. 
(63) To ensure that farmers receive payments as quickly as possible, provision should be made for granting advances. However, in view of the application of the national or regional ceilings, steps should be taken to ensure that the advance does not exceed the definitive payment. Provision should therefore be made to allow Member States to reduce the percentage of the advance for the premium schemes subject to those ceilings. 
(64) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 lays down penalties for the illegal use or holding of substances or products not authorised by the relevant veterinary legislation. In the case of repeated infringements, determination of the duration of penalties should be left to the Member States, which are better placed to judge the true gravity of the offence committed. 
(65) It is necessary to fix the date determining the elements to be taken into consideration for the application of the special premium and suckler cow premium schemes. In order to ensure sound and consistent administration, that date should, as a general rule, be the date of the submission of applications. However, with respect to the special premium paid on slaughter, special rules should be laid down in order to avoid carry-overs from one year to the next with a view to obtaining a higher premium. As regards the slaughter premium, the date of slaughter or of export is a better indication of whether the operations concerned have actually been carried out. 
(66) The exchange rate applicable on the date of the operative event for the premiums should be fixed in such a way as to ensure in principle that such premiums do not undergo any sharp fluctuations on conversion into national currency due to the exchange rate on a single date. 
(67) Provision should be made for the Member States to be subject to certain notification obligations. To facilitate the transmission and analysis of the data, a consistent format for submitting that data should be laid down. 
(68) In order to facilitate the change to the new scheme, transitional provisions are needed for the obligation to mark and identify animals. 
(69) Article 143b of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 allows the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (the new Member States) to replace the direct payments with a single payment ("the single area payment scheme"). The Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have made that choice. Therefore detailed rules for the application of the single area payment scheme should be laid down. 
(70) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 143b(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and in order to avoid managing numerous applications that would entail payments per holding lower than EUR 50, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have requested the authorisation to set the minimum size of eligible area par holding at a level higher than 0.3 ha. 
(71) The Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have estimated the part of their utilised agricultural area which has been maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 and have proposed to adjust it in accordance with the minimum size of eligible area per holding. 
(72) Article 143c of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility in the new Member States of complementing direct aid paid to a farmer, subject to authorisation by the Commission. The general modalities for implementing this possibility should be established. 
(73) Article 55(b) and the first indent of Article 107(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for exemption from set-aside if the land is used for producing materials for the manufacture within the Community of products not primarily intended for human or animal consumption, provided that effective control systems are applied. 
(74) The cultivation of sugarbeet, Jerusalem artichokes or chicory roots on land set aside should not be ruled out under certain conditions. Such crops cannot qualify for area payments in view of the risk of affecting the market in sugar. Care should nonetheless be taken to ensure that such crops comply with the rules governing the use of set-aside land. 
(75) The terms of eligibility for this scheme must be laid down. To this end it should be laid down that a contract must be concluded between the producer and the collector or first processor with respect to the agricultural raw materials concerned. Conditions should also be laid down for cases where processing is carried out by the farmer on the holding. 
(76) To guarantee conformity with point 7 of the Memorandum of understanding on certain oil seeds between the European Economic Community and the United States of America within the framework of the GATT, approved by Council Decision 93/355/EC [21], detailed implementing rules must be laid down to reduce, where necessary, the quantity of by-products which may be produced for human or animal consumption if the total quantity of those by-products exceeds 1 million metric tonnes annually, expressed in soya bean meal equivalents. 
(77) To ensure that the raw material is processed into the specified end product, collectors or first processors must lodge a security, even though the aid is granted to farmers. In addition, to make the control system for the scheme effective, the number of processors should be limited. 
(78) A clear distinction must be made between the applicant's obligations, which end once the total quantity of raw material harvested is delivered, and the obligations, including the requirement concerning securities, incumbent on collectors and first processors, which commence on delivery and end with the final processing of the raw materials into end products. 
(79) Certain transport operations within Community territory involving raw materials and products derived therefrom should be subject to controls entailing the use of declarations and T5 control copies to be issued in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Provision should be made for alternative evidence if the T5 control copy is not returned to the competent authorities of the collectors or first processors as a result of circumstances for which they are not responsible. In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme, provisions should be laid down to govern checks. 
(80) Apart from the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 110o of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for the hops area aid, some additional criteria should be established in order to en ensure that the aid if granted to areas on which hops is cultivated under normal cultivation conditions. The concept of an area "planted with hops" should be defined at Community level so as to ensure that the areas for which the additional payment is made are calculated in the same way. It is necessary to lay down the way in which the total sum per Member State available for the additional payments is distributed over the eligible areas. 
(81) A time limit should be set for committing the payment in respect of the measures listed in Article 7(1) (a) to (d) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops [22] by the recognised hop producer groups and the Commission should be informed about the way the payment has been used. Any amount not committed within a certain time period should be paid back. It is necessary to lay down the way in which the total sum per Member State available for the payment to recognised hop producer groups is distributed. 
(82) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,

For the purposes of determining any overshoot in the limited area for durum wheat eligible for the supplement to the area payment laid down in Article 105(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the competent authorities of the Member States shall take account of the sum of the areas covered by applications for the supplement to area payments in respect of durum wheat, adjusted in accordance with Article 59(2) of this Regulation and, where applicable, reduced in accordance with Article 102 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply for the purposes of determining any overshoot in the limited areas eligible for the special aid for durum wheat set out in Article 105(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
Article 61 
Definitive rate of areas overshoot and coefficient of reduction 
1. Where the areas referred to in Articles 59 and 60 are found to be exceeded, the Member State concerned shall, by 31 October of the year concerned at the latest, determine the definitive rate of overshoot truncated to two decimal points. 
2. The definitive rate of overshoot thus determined shall be used to calculate the proportional reduction in the area eligible for: 
(a) the arable crop area payment in accordance with Article 102(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; 
(b) the supplement thereto and the special aid for durum wheat in accordance with Article 105 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and after Article 102(1) of that Regulation has been applied. 
Article 62 
Sub-base areas 
For the purposes of Article 102(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the Member States shall, by 15 September of the year in respect of which the area payment is applied for at the latest, determine the following and shall notify the Commission thereof: 
(a) the national base area to be subdivided;

(c) the sub-base areas (number, name and size); 
(d) the detailed rules for concentrating measures applicable in case of overshoot. 
Article 63 
Ceiling of the sum of the payments 
For the purposes of determining any overshoot in the ceiling of the payments and the corresponding reduction coefficient provided for in Article 102(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the competent authorities of the Member States shall take account of the proportional reduction in the eligible areas provided for in Article 102(1) and Article 105(2) of that Regulation. 
SECTION 4

(b) in another region of production, provided that the areas to be set aside are located in regions of production adjacent to those in which the cultivated areas are situated. 
5. Where paragraphs 3 and 4 are applied, the area to be set aside shall be adjusted to take account of the difference between the yields used to calculate the payment in respect of set-aside in the regions concerned. However, the application of this paragraph shall not lead to fewer hectares being set aside than the obligation requires. 
Article 67 
Legume crops 
1. For the purposes of applying the second indent of Article 107(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, "legume crops" shall mean areas sown with one or more species of the fodder legumes listed in Annex VII to this Regulation.

Article 71 
Areas eligible for goat premium 
The criteria referred to in Article 113(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 are met in the areas listed in Annex X. 
However, Member States shall, on a regular basis, verify whether these criteria continue to be met in all the areas listed in Annex X falling within their respective territories. Following this evaluation, Member States shall notify the Commission of any need for amending Annex X before 31 July of the year preceding the year in respect of which the amendment shall apply. The notification shall, in particular, indicate the zones, or parts of zones, listed in Annex X that do not further meet the criteria referred to in Article 113(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, as well as the eventual zones that meet these criteria but are not yet listed in Annex X. For these potential new zones, the Member States shall supply the Commission with a detailed justification of their proposal. 
Article 72 
Application for supplementary premium and for the goat premium 
1. In order to benefit from the supplementary premium or the goat premium, a farmer whose holding has at least 50 % but less than 100 % of its area used for agriculture situated in areas referred to in Article 114(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or in areas listed in Annex X to this Regulation, shall submit a declaration or declarations indicating the location of his land, in accordance paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article: 
2. A farmer who is required to submit each year a declaration of the total utilised agricultural area of his holding, at the occasion of an aid application, as provided for in Article 22(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, shall indicate in that declaration those parcels used for agriculture which are located in areas referred to in Article 114(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or in areas listed in Annex X to this Regulation as appropriate; 
A farmer who is not required to submit the declaration referred to in the first paragraph shall submit each year a specific declaration using, where appropriate, the system for identifying agricultural parcels provided for under the integrated system.

SECTION 2 
Limits, Reserves and Transfers 
Article 77 
Rights obtained free of charge 
Except in duly justified exceptional circumstances, where a farmer has obtained premium rights free of charge from the national reserve he shall not be authorised to transfer his rights or to lease them temporarily for a period of three years from the date he obtained those rights. 
Article 78 
Use of rights 
1. A farmer holding rights may make use of them by availing himself of those rights and/or leasing those rights to another farmer. 
2. Where a farmer has not made use of the minimum percentage of his rights provided for paragraph 4, during each year, the part not used shall be transferred to the national reserve, except in the following cases: 
(a) in the case of farmers holding a maximum of 20 premium rights, where this farmer has not made use of the minimum percentage of his rights, during each of two consecutive calendar years, only the part not used during the last calendar year shall be transferred to the national reserve; 
(b) in the case of a farmer participating in an extensification programme recognised by the Commission; 
(c) in the case of a farmer participating in an early retirement scheme recognised by the Commission in which the transfer and/or temporary leasing of rights is not obligatory; 
(d) in exceptional and duly justified circumstances. 
3. Temporary leasing shall be only in respect of whole years and shall involve at least the minimum number of animals provided for in Article 79(1). At the end of each period of temporary leasing, which may not exceed three consecutive years, a farmer shall, except in the event of a transfer of rights, recover all his rights for himself, for at least two consecutive years. If the farmer does not avail himself of at least the minimum percentage of his rights provided for paragraph 4 during each of the two years, the Member State shall, except in exceptional and duly justified cases, withdraw and return annually to the national reserve that part of the rights not used by the farmer. 
However, in the case of farmers participating in early retirement schemes recognised by the Commission, Member States may provide for the total duration of the temporary leasing on the basis of such schemes to be increased. 
Farmers who have undertaken to participate in an extensification programme in accordance with the measure referred to in Article 2(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 [34] or in an extensification programme in accordance with Articles 22 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 shall not be authorised to temporarily lease and/or to transfer their rights throughout the period of that participation. However, this provision shall not apply in cases where the programme permits the transfer and/or temporary leasing of rights to farmers whose participation in measures other than those referred to in this subparagraph requires the acquisition of rights. 
4. The minimum percentage of use of rights to the premium shall be 70 %. 
However, Member States may increase that percentage up to 100 %. They shall inform the Commission in advance of the percentage they intend to apply. 
Article 79 
Transfer of rights and temporary leasing 
1. Member States may lay down, on the basis of their production structures, a minimum number of premium rights which may be the subject of a partial transfer not involving the transfer of a holding. This minimum may not exceed 10 premium rights. 
2. Transfers of premium rights and temporary leasing of such rights shall be effective only after they have been notified to the competent authorities of the Member State by the farmer transferring and/or leasing the rights and by the farmer receiving the rights. 
Such notification shall take place within a deadline set by the Member State and not later than the date on which the premium application period ends in that Member State, except in those cases where the transfer takes place through an inheritance. In those cases, the farmer who receives the rights shall be in a position to furnish appropriate legal documents to prove that he/she is the beneficiary of the deceased farmer. 
3. In the case of a transfer without a transfer of the holding, the number of rights transferred without compensation to the national reserve may in no case be less than one. 
Article 80 
Change of individual ceiling 
In the case of transfers or temporary leasing of premium rights, Member States shall set the new individual ceiling and shall notify the farmers concerned of the number of premium rights to which they are entitled not later than 60 days from the last day of the period during which the producer submitted his application. 
The first paragraph shall not apply in the case where the transfer takes effect through an inheritance as referred to in Article 79(2). 
Article 81 
Farmers who do not own the land they farm 
Farmers farming only publicly or collectively owned land who decide to stop using that land for grazing and to transfer all their rights to another farmer shall be treated in the same way as farmers selling or transferring their holdings. In all other cases such farmers shall be treated in the same way as farmers transferring their premium rights only. 
Article 82 
Transfer through the national reserve 
Where Member States provide that the transfer of rights is to take place via the national reserve, they shall apply national provisions analogous to those in this Chapter. Moreover, in such cases: 
(a) Member States may provide for temporary leasing to be carried out via the national reserve; 
(b) in the event of the transfer of premium rights or temporary leasing pursuant to point (a), transfer to the reserve shall not become effective until after notification by the competent authorities of the Member State to the farmer transferring and/or leasing the rights, and transfers from the reserve to another farmer shall not become effective until after notification to that farmer by the authorities. 
In addition, the national provisions referred to in the first paragraph shall ensure that the part of the rights not covered by the second subparagraph of Article 117(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 must be offset by a payment by the Member State corresponding to the payment which would have resulted from a direct transfer between farmers, account being taken in particular of the trend in production in the Member State concerned. That payment shall be equal to the payment charged to a farmer who receives equivalent rights from the national reserve. 
Article 83 
Calculation of individual limits 
Only whole numbers shall be used in the initial calculations and in subsequent adjustments to individual limits on premium rights. 
To that end, where the final result of the arithmetical calculations is not a whole number, the nearest whole number shall be used. However, where the result of the calculations falls exactly between whole numbers, the higher whole number shall be used. 
Article 84 
Notification 
1. Member States shall notify the Commission by 1 March 2005 at the latest of the part of the premiums rights transferred which shall be surrendered to the national reserve in accordance Article 117(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and where applicable of the measures taken under Article 117(3) of that Regulation and, before 1 January each year, of any amendments thereto. 
2. Using the table set out in Annexes XIII and XIV, Member States shall notify the Commission by 30 April at the latest for each year of: 
(a) the number of premium rights returned without compensatory payment to the national reserve following transfers of rights without transfers of holdings during the preceding year; 
(b) the number of unused premium rights as referred to in Article 118(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 transferred to the national reserve during the preceding year; 
(c) the number of rights granted under Article 118(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 during the preceding year; 
(d) the number of premium rights granted to farmers in less-favoured areas from the national reserve during the preceding year; 
(e) the dates concerning the periods and deadlines related to the transfers of rights and to the applications for the premium. 
SECTION 3

Article 89 
Passports and administrative documents 
1. Where, under the conditions laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, the passport is not available, it shall be replaced by a national administrative document as provided for in Article 123(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
2. The competent authorities of the Member State shall ensure that passports or administrative documents ensure that only one premium is granted per animal and per age bracket. Member States shall assist one another, as necessary, to this end.

However, Member States may provide that other starting dates may be set by the farmer on condition that they do not begin more than two months following the day on which the application is submitted. 
Article 91 
Regional ceiling 
1. Where the application of the proportional reduction provided for in Article 123(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 gives a number of eligible animals which is less than a whole number, there shall be granted in respect of the decimal part a corresponding fraction of the unit amount of the premium. For this purpose, account shall be taken of the first decimal place only.

3. Where Member States decide to grant the special premium at the time of slaughter in accordance with paragraph 1, this Section and Article 120 and Article 121(1) and (2) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the grant of the premium. 
4. In addition to the information referred to in Article 121(1), aid applications shall indicate whether the animal is a bull or a steer, and shall be accompanied by a document containing the details required for the purposes of Article 89(2). That document shall be one of the following, at the choice of the Member State:

Where the computerised databases as provided for in Article 3(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 contain, to the satisfaction of the Member State, the information necessary to ensure that one premium only is granted for each animal and each age bracket, the aid application need not be accompanied by the document referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. 
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, where Member States apply the option referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 121(2), they shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the farmer can determine the animals for which he is requesting a special premium. 
5. In the case of bulls, proof of slaughter shall specify the carcase weight. 
6. Where the animal is dispatched, proof of dispatch shall be provided by means of a statement by the consignor indicating the Member State of destination of the animal. 
In that case, aid applications shall include: 
(a) the name and address of the consignor (or an equivalent code); 
(b) the identity number of the animal; 
(c) a statement that the animal is not less than nine months old. 
Aid applications shall be submitted before the animal leaves the territory of the Member State concerned and proof of dispatch shall be submitted within three months from the date of the animals leaving the territory of the Member State concerned. 
Article 94 
Details of the grant system 
1. By way of derogation from Article 90, the premium shall be paid to farmers who have kept animals for a minimum retention period of two months ending less than one month before the date of slaughter or consignment or ending less than two months before the date of export. 
In the case of steers, payment of the premium shall be subject to the following rules: 
(a) the premium in respect of the first age bracket shall be paid only if the farmer has kept the animal for a period of not less than two months between the time when the animal was not less than seven months old and the time when it was less than 22 months old; 
(b) the premium in respect of the second age bracket may be paid only if the farmer has kept the animal aged not less than 20 months for a period of not less than two months; 
(c) the premiums in respect of the two age brackets may be paid together only if the farmer has kept the animal for not less than four consecutive months in compliance with the age requirements laid down in points (a) and (b); 
(d) the premium in respect of the second age bracket only may be paid if the animal was dispatched from another Member State when it had reached 19 months. 
2. In the context of calculating the stocking density provided for in Article 131 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, each animal which is the subject of a combined application for the two age brackets shall be taken into consideration twice. 
3. The carcase weight shall be established on the basis of a carcase within the meaning of Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1208/81 [35]. 
Where the carcase presentation differs from that definition, the corrective factors set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 563/82 [36] shall apply. 
Where slaughter takes place in a slaughterhouse which is not subject to the application of the Community grading scale for carcases of adult bovine animals, Member States may permit the weight to be established on the basis of the live weight of the slaughtered animal. In such cases the carcase weight shall be considered to be equal to or greater than 185 kilograms if the live weight of the slaughtered animal was equal to or greater than 340 kilograms.

Except in duly justified exceptional cases, where a farmer has obtained premium rights free of charge from the national reserve he shall not be authorised to transfer and/or temporarily lease his rights during the three following calendar years 
Article 108 
Use of rights 
1. A farmer holding rights may make use of them by availing himself of those rights and/or leasing those rights to another producer. 
2. Where a farmer has not made use of at least the minimum percentage of his rights, fixed in accordance with paragraph 4, during each calendar year, the part not used shall be transferred to the national reserve, except: 
- in the case of a farmer holding a maximum of seven premium rights, where this farmer has not made use of the minimum percentage of his rights, fixed it accordance with paragraph 4, during each of two consecutive calendar years, the part not used during the last calendar year shall be transferred to the national reserve, 
- in the case of a farmer participating in an extensification programme recognised by the Commission, 
- in the case of a farmer participating in an early retirement scheme recognised by the Commission in which the transfer and/or temporary leasing of rights is not obligatory, 
or 
- in exceptional and duly justified cases. 
3. Temporary leasing shall be only in respect of whole calendar years and shall involve at least the minimum number of animals provided for in Article 109(1). At the end of each period of temporary leasing, which may not exceed three consecutive years, a farmer shall, except in the event of a transfer of rights, recover all his rights for himself, for at least two consecutive calendar years. If the farmer does not avail himself of at least the minimum percentage of his rights, fixed in accordance with paragraph 4, during each of the two years, the Member State shall, except in exceptional and duly justified cases, withdraw and return annually to the national reserve that part of the rights not used by the farmer. 
However, in the case of farmers participating in early retirement schemes recognised by the Commission, Member States may provide for the total duration of the temporary leasing on the basis of such schemes to be increased. 
Farmers who have undertaken to participate in an extensification programme in accordance with the measure referred to in Article 2(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 [37] or in an extensification programme in accordance with Articles 22 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 [38] shall not be authorised to temporarily lease and/or to transfer their rights throughout the period of that participation. However, this provision shall not apply in cases where the programme permits the transfer and/or temporary leasing of rights to farmers whose participation in the measures other than those referred to in this subparagraph requires the acquisition of rights. 
4. The minimum percentage of use of rights to the premium shall be 70 %. However, the Member States may raise this percentage up to 100 %. 
The Member States shall inform the Commission in advance of the percentage that they intend to apply or of any change of this one. 
Article 109 
Transfer of rights and temporary leasing 
1. Member States may lay down, on the basis of their production structures, a minimum number of premium rights which may be the subject of a partial transfer not involving the transfer of a holding. This minimum may not exceed five premium rights. 
2. Transfers of premium rights and temporary leasing of such rights shall be effective only after they have been notified jointly to the competent authorities of the Member State by the farmer transferring and/or leasing the rights and by the farmer receiving the rights. 
Such notification shall take place within a deadline set by the Member State and not later than the date on which the farmer receiving the rights submits his premium application, except in those cases where the transfer of rights takes effect through an inheritance. In that case, the farmer who receives the rights shall be in a position to furnish appropriate legal documents to prove that he or she is the beneficiary of the deceased farmer. 
Article 110 
Change of individual ceiling 
In the case of transfers or temporary leasing of premium rights, Member States shall set the new individual ceiling and shall notify the farmers concerned of the number of premium rights to which they are entitled not later than 60 days from the last day of the period during which the farmer submitted his application. 
The first paragraph shall not apply in the case where the transfer takes effect through an inheritance. 
Article 111 
Farmers who do not own the land that they farm 
Farmers farming only public land or collectively owned land who decide to discontinue the farming of such land and to transfer all their rights to another farmer shall be treated in the same way as farmers selling or transferring their holdings. In all other cases such farmers shall be treated in the same way as farmers transferring their premium rights only. 
Article 112 
Transfer through the national reserve 
Where Member States provide that the transfer of rights without transfer of the holding is to take place through the national reserve in accordance with Article 127(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, they shall apply national provisions analogous to those set out in Articles 109 to 111. In addition, in this event: 
- Member States may provide that temporary leasing is to take place through the national reserve; 
- when premium rights are transferred, or temporarily leased in cases where the first indent is applied, transfers to the reserve shall be effective only after they have been notified by the competent authorities of the Member State to the farmer transferring and/or leasing the rights, and transfers from the reserve to another farmer shall be effective only after they have been notified to that farmer by these authorities. 
In addition, such provisions must ensure that a payment will be made by the Member State for that part of the rights other than the part referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 127(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 corresponding to that which would have resulted from a direct transfer between farmers, account being taken in particular of the trend of production in the Member State concerned. This payment shall be equal to the payment which will be claimed from farmers receiving equivalent rights from the national reserve. 
Article 113 
Partial rights 
1. Where calculations to be made pursuant to Articles 105 to 112 produce numbers which are not whole numbers, only the first decimal place shall be taken into account. 
2. Where application of the provisions of this Section results in partial premium rights, either for farmers or the national reserve, these partial rights shall be added up. 
3. Where a farmer holds a partial right, this partial right shall only confer entitlement to the corresponding fraction of the unit amount of the premium and, where applicable, of the additional national premium referred to in Article 104 and of the extensification payment referred to in Article 118. 
Article 114 
Special scheme for heifers 
1. Member States wishing to make use of the possibility stipulated in Article 129(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall inform the Commission thereof and, at the same time, notify the Commission of the relevant data allowing establishing whether the conditions laid down in Article 129(1) of that Regulation are met.

3. Member States applying the special scheme shall lay down criteria to ensure that the premium is paid to farmers whose herd of heifers is intended to restock cow herds. These criteria may include in particular an age limit and/or breed requirements. Member States shall inform the Commission before 1 January of the year concerned of the criteria adopted. Any subsequent modification shall be notified to the Commission before 1 January of the year concerned. 
4. Where the application of the proportional reduction referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 129(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 gives a number of eligible animals which is less than a whole number, there shall be granted in respect of the decimal part a corresponding fraction of the unit amount of the premium and, where applicable, of the additional national premium referred to in Article 104 and of the extensification payment referred to in Article 118. For this purpose account shall be taken of the first decimal place only. 
5. In Member States applying the special scheme, the requirement laid down in Article 125(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 concerning the minimum number of animals to be held shall be met in full either by suckler cows if the farmer has lodged an application for suckler cows or by heifers if the farmer has lodged an application for heifers. 
6. The provisions of Articles 105 to 113 shall not apply within this special scheme. 
Article 115 
Rounding-off of animal numbers 
If the calculation of the maximum number of heifers as a percentage as laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 125(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 produces a result which is not a whole number, that number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number if it is less than 0.5 and up to the nearest whole number if it is 0.5 or more.

Stocking density 
1. For each farmer who, in respect of the same calendar year, submits an application for direct payments referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for a special premium or a suckler cow premium, the competent authorities shall establish the number of LUs (livestock units) corresponding to the number of animals for which a special premium or suckler cow premium may be granted, taking account of the forage area of his holding. 
2. In establishing the stocking density referred to in Article 131 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the following procedure shall apply: 
(a) account shall be taken of the individual reference quantity of milk available to the farmer on 31 March preceding the beginning of the period of 12 months of application of the additional levy scheme beginning in the calendar year concerned;

Article 118a 
Determination of stocking density by way of census 
1. In order to check that the total number of animals calculated in accordance with Article 132(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 meets the stocking density requirements laid down in Article 132(2) of that Regulation, Member States shall determine each year at least five census dates for the animals and shall inform the Commission thereof. 
Except in those cases where Member States decide that the census dates may be any day of the year, the census dates shall be distributed at random in such a way as to be representative of the entire year, being changed annually, and each census date shall be determined a posteriori and notified to the farmer at the earliest two weeks after it has been determined. 
2. On census dates the animals shall be counted in accordance with one of the following methods, at the choice of the Member State: 
(a) Member States may ask each farmer to declare, on the basis of his farm register, prior to a date to be determined by the Member State, the number of LUs or the number of animals of each of the two categories of bovine animals referred to in the conversion table laid down in Article 131(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; 
(b) Member States may use the computerised databases referred to in Article 3(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 to determine the number of LUs on condition that those databases offer, to the satisfaction of the Member State concerned, adequate assurances as to the accuracy of the data they contain for the purposes of the extensification payment scheme. 
3. The number of LUs used to determine whether the farmer is complying with the stocking density requirements laid down in Article 132(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be the arithmetic average of the numbers of LUs counted on the census dates plus the number of LUs corresponding to the sheep and goats for which premium applications have been submitted for the same calendar year. 
However, where Member States decide that the census dates may be any day of the year, they may provide that the numbers referred to in paragraph 2(a) and (b) shall be calculated pro rata temporis for the period on which the animals are present on the holding. 
4. Member States shall take the measures necessary to apply Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 in the case of farmers who, by means of abnormally low stocking rates during part of the year, artificially create the conditions required by Article 132 of that Regulation. 
Article 118b 
Simplified determination of stocking density 
1. By way of derogation from Article 118a, Member States may give farmers the option of choosing a simplified scheme for calculating the stocking density.

Where the Member State concerned has chosen to apply the second subparagraph of Article 132(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the farmer shall specify on his application which of the two maximum stocking densities he is observing. The farmer may alter that choice before the announcement of an on-the-spot check on the number of his animals. 
The farmer may notify the competent authority of the cancellation of the undertaking referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph before the announcement of an on-the-spot check on the number of his animals. In that case he shall not qualify for the extensification payment. 
The declaration and undertaking provided for in the second subparagraph shall be subject to the control and penalty provisions provided for under the integrated system. 
2. Where Member States choose to apply, or to cease to apply, the option laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 132(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, they shall inform the Commission of their decision before 1 January of the calendar year concerned.

2. Without prejudice to Article 118(1), farmers who wish to qualify for the extensification payment under paragraph 1 of this Article shall state on the aid application that they are applying for the extensification payment. Farmers shall keep, for at least six consecutive months starting on the date on which the application referred to in Article 118 is submitted, a number of dairy cows at least equal to the number of dairy cows for which the extensification payment has been applied for. That six-month retention period shall start on the day following that on which the application is submitted. 
Applications shall be submitted within an overall period of six months during a calendar year, to be determined by the Member State. 
Member States may provide for separate submission periods within that overall period. 
Article 118d 
Maximum number of dairy cows eligible for payment 
The number of dairy cows for which the extensification payment is granted to a farmer may not exceed either of the following two figures: 
(a) the number of dairy cows needed to produce the individual reference quantity of milk available to the farmer on 31 March preceding the beginning of the 12-month period of application of the additional levy scheme beginning in the calendar year concerned; that number of cows shall be calculated using the average milk yield defined in Annex XVI; 
(b) the total number of cows on the holding, determined in accordance with Article 118a, less the number of suckler cows corresponding to the individual ceiling. 
Article 119 
General provisions 
1. Member States shall notify the Commission of any amendment to the definition of "pasture land" used for the purposes of Article 132(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 before 1 January of the year concerned. 
2. For the purpose of calculating the stocking density pursuant to this Sub-section, account shall be taken of the first two decimal places only. 
3. In the event that the competent veterinary authorities decide that no animal may leave the production unit except for the purpose of slaughter, the number of livestock units recorded on the holding shall be multiplied by the coefficient 0.8 for the purpose of applying this Sub-section. 
That measure shall be restricted to the period, plus 20 days, within which the decision referred to in the first subparagraph applies, provided that the farmer has informed the competent authority, by writing within 10 working days of the decision, of the presence of the animals concerned and has taken all the measures necessary to prevent and/or limit the occurrence of the epizootic. 
SECTION 5 
Slaughter premium 
(Article 130 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003) 
Article 120 
Member States may provide that in order to qualify for the slaughter premium for a given calendar year each farmer shall, before or at the same time as making the first application for that calendar year, submit a statement of participation.

3. For animals which have been the subject of intra-Community trade after the retention period referred to in Article 123, even if the Member State where slaughter was carried out chose to apply the derogation laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article, the slaughterhouse shall issue the document referred to in point (a) of the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article. 
However, where their data transfer systems are compatible, two Member States may agree to apply the system described in paragraph 2. 
Member States shall assist one another to ensure effective controls on the authenticity of documents submitted and/or the accuracy of the data exchanged. To that end the Member State where payment is made shall forward regularly to the Member State where slaughter takes place a summary, grouped by slaughterhouse, of the slaughter certificates (or information in place thereof) received from the latter Member State.

1. Any agricultural raw material may be grown on the areas set aside pursuant to Article 55(b) and the first indent of Article 107(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
The economic value of the products used for non-food purposes referred to in Annex XXIII to this Regulation obtained by processing raw materials shall be higher than that of all other products intended for other uses and obtained by such processing, as determined by the valuation method set out in Article 163(3) of this Regulation. 
2. The raw materials referred to in paragraph 1 shall be covered by a contract in accordance with Article 147 of this Regulation, without prejudice to Article 148. 
3. Applicants shall deliver all raw materials harvested to a collector or first processor who shall take delivery of them and ensure that an equivalent quantity of such raw materials is used within the Community for the manufacture of one or more end products intended for non-food purposes as listed in Annex XXIII. 
Where the first processor uses the raw material actually harvested to manufacture an intermediate product or a by-product, he may use an equivalent quantity of such intermediate products or by-products to manufacture one or more end products as referred to in the first subparagraph. 
In the case referred to in the second subparagraph, or where the collector sells an equivalent quantity of the raw material harvested, the first processor or the collector shall so inform the competent authority with whom the security is lodged. Where such equivalent quantity is used in a Member State other than that in which the raw material is harvested, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform each other of the details of such transaction.

ANNEX I 
TEST FOR BITTER LUPINS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2(5) 
To be performed on a sample of 200 grains taken from a batch of 1 kg from each lot of 20 t maximum. 
The test is intended solely to provide qualitative evidence of the presence of bitter grains in the sample. The homogeneity tolerance is 1 grain per 100. Use the Grain-Cut method according to Von Sengbusch (1942), Ivanov and Smirnova (1932) and Eggebrecht (1949). Cut the dry or swollen grains crosswise. Place the half-grains in a sieve and dip in an iodine solution for ten seconds, then rinse under water for five seconds. The cut surfaces of bitter grains turn brown while those low in alkaloids remain yellow. 
To prepare the iodine solution, dissolve 14 g of potassium iodate in as little water as possible, add 10 g of iodine and dilute to 1000 cm3. Leave the solution to stand for one week before use. Store in brown bottles. Dilute the stock solution to three to five times its initial volume before using.

ANNEX II 
CROP-SPECIFIC PAYMENT FOR RICE 
Calculation of the coefficient of reduction referred to in Article 13 
1. For the observation of a possible overrun of the base area referred to in Article 82 of the Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the competent authority of the Member State shall take into account, on the one hand, the base areas or sub-base areas, fixed in Article 81 of that Regulation, and on the other hand, the total of the areas for which aid applications have been submitted for these base areas and sub-base areas. 
2. In establishing the total area for which aid applications have been submitted, account shall not be taken of applications or parts of applications that a check has shown to be clearly unjustified. 
3. If an overrun is observed for certain base areas or sub-base areas, the Member State shall establish for these, the percentage of overrun, calculated with two decimal places according to the deadline fixed in Article 18(2) of this Regulation. When an overrun can be foreseen, the Member State shall inform the producers forthwith. 
4. The coefficient of reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice shall be calculated, in accordance with Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, according to the following formula: 
Reduction coefficient = reference area of the sub-base area divided by the total area for which aid applications have been submitted for this sub-base area. 
The reduced crop-specific payment for rice shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
Reduced crop-specific aid for rice = crop-specific aid for rice multiplied by the reduction coefficient. 
This reduction coefficient and this reduced crop-specific payment for rice shall be calculated for each sub-base area, after application of the redistribution provided for in Article 82(2) of Regulation.(EC) No 1782/2003. Redistribution shall be done to the profit of the sub-base areas for which limits have been exceeded. It shall be done proportionally to the overruns noted in the sub-base areas for which limits have been exceeded.
