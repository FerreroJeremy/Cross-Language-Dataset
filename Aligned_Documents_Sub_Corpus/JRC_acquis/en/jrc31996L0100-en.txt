Directive 96/100/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 February 1997 amending the Annex to Directive 93/7/EEC on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State 
DIRECTIVE 96/100/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 February 1997 amending the Annex to Directive 93/7/EEC on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3), 
Whereas according to different artistic traditions within the Community water-colour, gouache and pastel pictures are variously regarded as being either paintings or drawings; whereas Category 4 of the Annex to Directive No 93/7/EEC (4) includes drawings executed entirely by hand on any medium in any material, and Category 3 includes pictures and paintings executed entirely by hand on any medium in any material; whereas the financial thresholds which apply to these two categories are different; whereas in the internal market this could lead to serious differences of treatment for water-colour, gouache and pastel pictures depending upon the Member State in which they are situated; whereas it is necessary to decide for the purposes of the application of the Directive into which category they shall fall to ensure that the financial thresholds applied shall be the same throughout the Community; 
Whereas experience shows that the prices realized by water-colour, gouache and pastel pictures tend to be rather higher than those realized by drawings and much lower than those fetched by paintings in oil or tempora; whereas accordingly it is expedient to place water-colour, gouache and pastel pictures into a new separate category with a threshold of ECU 30 000 which would ensure that works of major significance unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State can be returned, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
