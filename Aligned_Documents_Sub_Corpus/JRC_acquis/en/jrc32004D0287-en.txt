(2004/287/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed(1), and in particular Article 17(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants(2), and in particular Article 21(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In France the quantity of available seed of field bean (Vicia faba) and of soya bean (Glycine max) suitable to the national climatic conditions and which satisfies the germination capacity requirements of Directives 66/401/EEC or 2002/57/EC respectively is insufficient and is therefore not adequate to meet the needs of that Member State. 
(2) It is not possible to meet the demand for seed of these species satisfactorily with seed from other Member States or from third countries which satisfies all the requirements laid down in Directives 66/401/EEC or 2002/57/EC respectively. 
(3) Accordingly, France should be authorised to permit the marketing of seed of these species subject to less stringent requirements for a period expiring on 30 April 2004. 
(4) In addition, other Member States irrespective of whether the seed was harvested in a Member State or in a third country covered by Council Decision 2003/17/EC of 16 December 2002 on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and the equivalence of seed produced in third countries(3) which are in a position to supply France with seed of that species, should be authorised to permit the marketing of such seed. 
(5) It is appropriate that France act as coordinator in order to ensure that the total amount of seed authorised pursuant to this Decision does not exceed the maximum quantity covered by this Decision. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION
