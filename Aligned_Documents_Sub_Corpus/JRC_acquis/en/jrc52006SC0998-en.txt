Draft 
DECISION OF THE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE 
amending Annex XIII (Transport) to the EEA Agreement 
- Draft common position of the Community - (presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In order to ensure the requisite legal security and homogeneity, the EEA Joint Committee is to integrate all the relevant Community legislation into the EEA Agreement as soon as possible after its adoption. 
2. The EEA Joint Committee should therefore adopt the attached draft decision to amend Annex XIII to the EEA Agreement by adding recently adopted acquis in the field of Transport. The decision concerns: 
32006 R 0336 : Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2006 on the implementation of the International Safety Management Code within the Community and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 3051/95 (OJ L 64, 4.3.2006, p. 1) 
3. The draft decision contains adaptations in view of the specific situation in the EEA EFTA countries. The abovementioned regulation will not apply to the existing Safety Management Code in Norway. An adaptation is proposed in Article 3(2)(e) subject to the conditions detailed in the decision. 
Since 1990 Norway made the International Safety Management Code mandatory for passenger ships carrying more than 100 passengers in all sea areas. However, Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 does not apply to passengers ships, other than ro-ro ferries in sea areas of Class C and D. Therefore Norway has stricter regulations for its domestic fleet, which are not covered by the EC Regulation. Norway wishes to maintain in place a Safety Management System for companies operating such ships in order to ensure the appropriate level of safety for the domestic fleet, as provided by their own stricter national legislation. 
4. Article 1(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning the arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement envisages that the Council establish the Community position for decisions extending Community legislation with substantial changes. 
5. The draft decision of the EEA Joint Committee is submitted for the approval of the Council, after which the Commission will put forward the position of the Community in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible occasion.
