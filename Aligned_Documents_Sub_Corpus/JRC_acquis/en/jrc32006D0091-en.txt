(2006/91/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 9(3) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [2], and in particular Article 10(3) thereof, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of 26 May 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [3], and in particular Article 18 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread from wild birds to domestic birds, notably poultry, and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products. 
(2) Slovenia has informed the Commission about the isolation of an H5 avian influenza virus collected from a clinical case in wild birds. Pending the determination of the neuraminidase (N) type and of the pathogenicity index, the clinical picture and the epidemiological circumstances allow the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza A virus of subtype H5N1. 
(3) Slovenia has without undue delay implemented certain measures foreseen in the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza [4]. 
(4) Given the disease risk, interim protection measures should be adopted in order to address the particular risks in different areas. 
(5) In the interests of consistency, it is appropriate to apply for the purposes of this Decision certain definitions provided for in Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC [5], Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs [6], Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin [7], Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [8]. 
(6) Protection and surveillance zones should be established around the place where the disease was detected in wild birds. Those zones should be limited to what is necessary to prevent virus introduction into commercial and non-commercial poultry flocks. 
(7) It is appropriate to control and restrict the movement of, in particular, live birds and hatching eggs while allowing the controlled dispatch from the zones of such birds and products of avian origin subject to certain conditions. 
(8) The measures laid down in Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk [9] should be implemented in protection and surveillance zones, independently of the defined risk status of the area where highly pathogenic avian influenza is suspected or confirmed in wild birds. 
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [10] authorises the placing on the market of a range of animal by-products, such as gelatine for technical use, materials for pharmaceutical use and others, originating in areas of the Community under animal health restrictions, because those products are considered safe due to the specific conditions of production, processing and utilisation that effectively inactivate possible pathogens or prevent contact with susceptible animals. It is therefore appropriate to permit the transport from protection zones of unprocessed used litter or manure for the purposes of treatment in accordance with that Regulation and of animal by-products complying with the conditions set out therein. 
(10) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC [11] provides for approved bodies, institutes and centres and a model certificate to accompany animals or their gametes between such approved premises in different Member States. A derogation from the transport restrictions should be envisaged for birds coming from and proceeding to bodies, institutes and centres approved in accordance with that Directive. 
(11) Transport of hatching eggs from the protection zones should be permitted under certain conditions. The dispatch of hatching eggs to other countries may be permitted subject in particular to compliance with the conditions referred to in Directive 2005/94/EC. In such cases the animal health certificates provided for in accordance with Directive 90/539/EEC should include a reference to this Decision. 
(12) The dispatch from protection zones of meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products should be permitted subject to certain conditions, in particular as regards compliance with certain requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [12]. 
(13) Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [13] establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, and provides for the possibility to establish a specific health mark and the health mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the protection zones of meat bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and meat products subjected to treatment referred to therein. 
(14) Pending the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and in collaboration with the Member State concerned the Commission should take interim protection measures relating to highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds. 
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision should be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
