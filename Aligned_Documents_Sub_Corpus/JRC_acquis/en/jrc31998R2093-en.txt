THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1587/96 (2), and in particular Article 6(6) thereof, 
Whereas pursuant to Article l of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3143/85 of 11 November 1985 on the sale at reduced prices of intervention butter intended for direct consumption in the form of concentrated butter (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1802/95 (4), the butter put up for sale must have been taken into storage before a date to be determined; whereas the same procedure is followed for the sale of butter under the arrangements laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, icecream and other foodstuffs (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1982/98 (6);
