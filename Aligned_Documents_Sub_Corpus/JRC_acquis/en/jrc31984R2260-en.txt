COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2260/84 
of 17 July 1984 
amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Article 11 (6) of Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1556/84 (5), provides that a percentage of the consumption aid is to be allocated to publicity campaigns and possibly to other projects for the promotion of the consumption of olive oil in the Community; whereas, in the light of the situation on the market in olive oil, in particular following the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Community, provision should be made for the possibility of allocating the percentage referred to above for the promotion of the consumption of Community olive oil on both the Community and the world markets; 
Whereas, under Article 20d (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, recognized groups or recognized associations may withhold as a fee, a percentage to be determined of the amount of production aid paid to them; whereas, in order to ensure that the system of production aid is applied more effectively, that provision should be amended to cover more approximately the expenditure arising from the supervision by producer organizations and associations thereof provided for in the context of the production aid scheme; 
Whereas Article 20d (3) of the said Regulation provides that recognized producer groups and recognized associations may conclude storage contracts in respect of the olive oil which they market; whereas, in view of their structure and objectives, this possibility should be restricted to producer groups and associations recognized within the meaning of Regulation (EEC) No 1360/78 (6) whose tasks include the placing of the olive oil on the market,
