THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Canary Islands with regard to certain agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 3(4) and Article 4(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In application of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 it is necessary to determine for the eggs and poultrymeat sectors and for the 2001/02 marketing year, on the one hand, the quantities of meat and eggs of the forecast supply balance which benefit from an exemption from the duty on imports from third countries or from an aid for deliveries originating in the rest of the Community, and on the other hand, the quantities of breeding material originating in the Community which benefit from an aid with a view to developing the potential for production in the archipelago of the Canaries. 
(2) It is appropriate to fix the amounts of the aids referred to above for the supply to the archipelago, on the one hand, of meat and eggs, and, on the other hand, of breeding materials originating in the rest of the Community. These aids must be fixed taking into account in particular the costs of supply from the world market, conditions due to the geographical situation of the archipelago and the basis of the current prices on export to third countries for the animals or products concerned. 
(3) The common detailed implementing rules for the supply regime for the Canary Islands for certain agricultural products were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2790/94(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1620/1999(4). 
(4) Pending the entry into force of the reform of the specific supply arrangements and in order to avoid any break in the application of the specific supply arrangements in force, the supply balance should be established for the period 1 July to 31 December 2001. 
(5) Pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92, the supply arrangements apply from 1 July; whereas the provisions of this Regulation should enter into force immediately. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,
