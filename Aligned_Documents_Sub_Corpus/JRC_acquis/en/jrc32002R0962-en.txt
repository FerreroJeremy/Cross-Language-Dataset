Council Regulation (EC) No 962/2002 
of 27 May 2002 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36 and 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94(4) fixes the potato starch quotas for producer Member States for the 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 marketing years. 
(2) Under Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 the quota is to be allocated between producer Member States at three-yearly intervals on the basis of the report from the Commission to the Council. The quotas currently fixed for the 2001/2002 marketing year should therefore be extended for three years. 
(3) The Commission reserves the right to make other appropriate legislative proposals for the potato starch system in the light of the ongoing evaluation of the sector. 
(4) Producer Member States should allocate their quotas for a period of three years between all potato starch manufacturers on the basis of the quotas adopted for the 2001/02 marketing year. 
(5) Quantities used in excess of the subquotas available in the 2001/2002 marketing year must be deducted for the 2002/2003 marketing year in accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. 
(6) The amendment of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92(5) by Council Regulation (EC) No 1253/1999(6) involved changes to the payment terminology in Article 8; this Regulation should therefore be brought into line with that terminology,
