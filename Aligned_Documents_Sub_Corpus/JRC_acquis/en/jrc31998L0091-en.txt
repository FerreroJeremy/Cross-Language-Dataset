Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 1998 relating to motor vehicles and their trailers intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road and amending Directive 70/156/EEC relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers 
DIRECTIVE 98/91/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 1998 relating to motor vehicles and their trailers intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road and amending Directive 70/156/EEC relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3), 
Having regard to Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (4), which transposes into Community law the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR), 
Whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured; 
Whereas total harmonisation regarding the technical requirements for vehicles intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road is necessary in order fully to achieve that objective; 
Whereas technical barriers to trade regarding the provisions for EC type approval of vehicles intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road should be eliminated in order to allow the market organisation in question to operate smoothly; 
Whereas it is therefore necessary in the context of the internal market to harmonise the standards for means of transport of dangerous goods by road; 
Whereas it is necessary to harmonise the approval procedures in the Member States; 
Whereas this Directive will be one of the separate Directives which must be fulfilled in order to comply with the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Directive 70/156/EEC (5) and in order to ensure the conformity of vehicles with the requirements of the EC type-approval procedure established by that Directive; whereas, therefore, the provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicles apply to this Directive; 
Whereas, in particular, Article 3(4) and Article 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC require each separate Directive to have an information document attached to it incorporating the relevant items of Annex I to that Directive and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI thereto in order that type approval may be computerised, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
This Directive shall apply to vehicles of categories 'N` and 'O`, as defined in Article 2 and Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC, intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road within or between Member States. 
The scope, definition, classification and requirements relating to such vehicles and the administrative provisions for EC type approval thereof are set out in Annexes I and II respectively to this Directive. 
Article 2 
For the purposes of this Directive: 
- 'dangerous goods` shall mean substances and articles as defined in Article 2 of Directive 94/55/EC, 
- 'transport` shall mean road transport operation as defined in Article 2 of Directive 94/55/EC. 
Article 3 
Directive 70/156/EEC shall be amended by the addition of:
