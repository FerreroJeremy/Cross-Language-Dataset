EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The 2002 Copenhagen European Council, closing accession negotiations with ten new States, recognised that enlargement presented an important opportunity to take forward relations with neighbouring countries based on shared values, and stated that the Union remained determined to avoid new dividing lines in Europe and to promote stability and prosperity within and beyond the new borders of the Union. 
The Commission Communication “Wider Europe - Neighbourhood: A New Framework for Relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours” of March 2003[1] proposed the establishment of Action Plans with partner countries. On 16 June 2003, the Council welcomed this Communication and invited the Commission, with the contribution, where appropriate, of the High Representative, to present proposals for Action Plans for all countries concerned as appropriate, commencing with Ukraine, Moldova, and Southern Mediterranean partners with Association Agreements. 
On 14 June 2004, the Council welcomed the Commission Communication “European Neighbourhood Policy – Strategy Paper”[2]. The Council also welcomed the Commission proposal to pursue the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) through Action Plans to be agreed jointly with the neighbouring countries concerned and invited the Commission to propose such Action Plans. The Council also defined how to advance and monitor implementation of such Action Plans. 
The Commission Communication of December 2004[3] submitted to the Council for approval a first set of draft Action Plans while the Commission Communication of March 2005[4] submitted the Country Reports for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia and Lebanon recommending the starting of negotiations for the drawing up of Action Plans with these countries. On 16 and 17 June 2005, the Council welcomed the decision to establish Action Plans with the above mentioned countries. 
The Commission, in close cooperation with the Presidency and the High Representative on issues related to political cooperation and the CFSP, has held exploratory talks with Azerbaijan which have resulted in agreement on a draft Action Plan. It covers a timeframe of five years. Its implementation will help fulfil the provisions in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and will contribute to an increasingly close relationship with Azerbaijan, involving a significant degree of economic integration and a deepening of political co-operation. Implementation of the Action Plan will significantly advance the approximation of Azerbaijani legislation, norms and standards to those of the European Union. 
The Action Plan is a broad tool for economic and political co-operation, carrying to a further stage the commitments and objectives contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. 
In accordance with the Council Conclusions of 14 June 2004, stipulating that the Action Plans will be approved by the Council and subsequently endorsed by the respective Association or Co-operation Councils, the Commission attaches the text of a proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken by the Communities and their Member States within the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Council with regard to the adoption of a Recommendation on the implementation of the Action Plan in annex.

ANNEXE EU-AZERBAIJAN ENP ACTION PLAN 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 has brought a historical shift for the Union in political, geographic and economic terms, further reinforcing the political and economic interdependence between the EU and Azerbaijan. It offers the opportunity for the EU and Azerbaijan to develop an increasingly close mutually beneficial relationship, going beyond co-operation, to involve a significant measure of economic integration and a deepening of political co-operation. The European Union and Azerbaijan are determined to make use of this occasion to enhance their relations and to promote stability, security and welfare. The approach is founded on partnership, joint ownership and differentiation. 
The European Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union sets ambitious objectives based on mutual commitments of the EU and its Member States and Azerbaijan to common values, including the respect of and support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of internationally recognised borders of each other and compliance to international and European norms and principles as well as support for effective implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms. Any breach to these norms and principles by either party to the Action Plan will result in the immediate suspension of its implementation. 
Azerbaijan is invited to enter into intensified political, security, economic and cultural relations with the EU, enhanced regional and cross border co-operation and shared responsibility in conflict prevention and conflict resolution. 
The level of ambition of the relationship will depend on the degree of Azerbaijan’s commitment to common values as well as its capacity to implement jointly agreed priorities. The pace of progress of the relationship will acknowledge fully Azerbaijan’s efforts and concrete achievements in meeting those commitments. 
This Action Plan is a first step in this process. The EU-Azerbaijan Action Plan is a political document laying out the strategic objectives of the cooperation between Azerbaijan and the EU. It covers a timeframe of five years. Its implementation will help fulfil the provisions in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) and will encourage and support Azerbaijan’s objective of further integration into European structures. The EU takes note of Azerbaijan’s expressed European aspirations. 
Implementation of the Action Plan will significantly advance the approximation of Azerbaijani legislation, norms and standards to those of the European Union . In this context, it will build solid foundations for further economic integration based on the adoption and implementation of economic and trade-related rules and regulations with the potential to enhance trade, investment and growth. It will furthermore help to devise and implement policies and measures to promote economic growth and social cohesion, to reduce poverty and to protect the environment, thereby contributing to the long-term objective of sustainable development. Azerbaijan and the EU will cooperate closely in implementing this Action Plan. 
The EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus will assist the relevant bodies in the implementation of this Action Plan in accordance with his mandate. 
2. NEW PARTNERSHIP PERSPECTIVES 
The European Neighbourhood Policy opens new partnership perspectives: 
- The perspective of moving beyond cooperation to a significant degree of integration, including through a stake in the EU’s Internal Market, and the possibility for Azerbaijan to participate progressively in key aspects of EU policies and programmes; 
- An upgrade in the scope and intensity of political cooperation, through further development of mechanisms for political dialogue and consultations on security issues that affect the interests of both sides; 
- Continuing strong EU commitment to support the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, drawing on the instruments at the EU’s disposal, including the EUSR, and in close consultation with the OSCE. The EU is ready to consider ways to strengthen further its engagement in conflict resolution and post-conflict rehabilitation; 
- Deepening trade and economic relations; providing the opportunity for convergence of economic legislation, the opening of economies to each other, and the continued reduction of non-tariff barriers to trade, which will stimulate investment and growth; 
- Increased financial support: EU financial assistance for Azerbaijan will be available to support the actions identified in the present document. The Commission is furthermore proposing a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) for this purpose, which will cover the main part of EU financial assistance and will include aspects of cross-border and trans-national cooperation. The Commission also intends to propose an extension of the EIB mandate to Azerbaijan as of 2007; 
- Possibilities of gradual opening of or reinforced participation in certain Community programmes, promoting cultural, educational, environmental, technical and scientific links; 
- Support including technical assistance and twinning to meet EU norms and standards, and targeted advice and support for legislative approximation through a mechanism such as TAIEX; 
- Establish a dialogue in accordance with the acquis on matters related to the movement of people between the EU and Azerbaijan; 
- Opening as soon as possible of a Commission Delegation in Azerbaijan. 
In light of the fulfilment of the objectives of this Action Plan and of the overall evolution of EU-Azerbaijan relations, consideration will be given in due time to the possibility of a new contractual relationship.
