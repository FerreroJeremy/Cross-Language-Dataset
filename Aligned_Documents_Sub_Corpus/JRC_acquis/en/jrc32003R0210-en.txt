THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 of 17 May 1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1038/2001(2), and in particular Article 9 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Eligibility for the area aid under the general scheme referred to in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 is subject to an obligation to set land aside. 
(2) The detailed rules of application fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 327/2002(4), stipulate that the set aside period must begin no later than 15 January and that no agricultural production is authorised on the land set aside. 
(3) As a result of adverse weather conditions the producers in various regions of some Member States cannot harvest notably potatoes, maize or their sugar and fodder beet before 15 January 2003, on lands to be set aside in the 2003/2004 marketing year. Under the circumstances, and as an exceptional measure, where growers so request they should be authorised to harvest their crops no later than 28 February 2003 without this affecting recognition of the lands in question as properly set aside, provided that they prove that the applicable conditions have been complied with. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
