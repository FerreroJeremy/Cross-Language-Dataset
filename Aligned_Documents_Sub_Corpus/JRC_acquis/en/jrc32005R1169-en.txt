(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 [2] lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 [3] lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention.

Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
(5) With a view to modernising the management of the system, provision should be made for the electronic transmission of the information required by the Commission.

Reference samples for counter-analysis shall be taken and analysed within seven working days of the date of the successful tenderer's request or within three working days if the samples are taken on removal from storage. 
In the event of a dispute, the analysis results shall be forwarded electronically to the Commission. 
Article 7 
1. The successful tenderer must accept the lot as established if the final result of the sample analyses indicates a quality: 
(a) higher than that specified in the notice of invitation to tender; 
(b) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, providing that the differences do not exceed the following limits: 
- one kilogram per hectolitre as regards specific weight, which must not, however, be less than 68 kg/hl,

Article 8 
Should the cases mentioned in Article 7(2)(b) and 7(3) arise, the successful tenderer may ask the intervention agency to supply an alternative lot of rye of the requisite quality, at no extra cost. In that case, the security shall not be released. The lot must be replaced within three days of the date of the successful tenderer's request. The successful tenderer shall immediately inform the Commission thereof using the form in Annex I. 
If, following successive replacements, the successful tenderer has not received a replacement lot of the quality laid down within one month of the date of the request for a replacement, the successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations and the securities shall be released, provided the Commission and the intervention agency have been immediately informed using the form in Annex I. 
Article 9 
1. If the rye is removed before the results of the analyses provided for in Article 6 are known, all risks shall be borne by the successful tenderer from the time the lot is removed, without prejudice to any means of redress the tenderer might have against the storer.

The costs of inter-bin transfers and any additional analyses requested by a successful tenderer shall be borne by that tenderer.

Half of the security shall be lodged when the licence is issued and the balance shall be lodged before the cereals are removed. 
Article 12 
Within two hours of the expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders, the German intervention agency shall electronically notify the Commission of tenders received. This notification shall be made by e-mail, using the form in Annex III.
