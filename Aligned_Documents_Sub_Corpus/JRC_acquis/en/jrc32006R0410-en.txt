of 9 March 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 26(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 1(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products [2], provides that exports from the Community of products for which an export refund is requested shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence. 
(2) However, the second subparagraph of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 further lays down that an export licence must also be presented for the products referred to in category II of Annex I thereto, where no refund is applied for, except in the cases referred to in the first and fourth indents of Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 [3]. 
(3) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 provides that a licence is not to be required and may not be produced for the purposes of exports with export refunds relating inter alia to small quantities not exceeding those set out in Annex III to that Regulation. 
(4) It is appropriate, where exports without refunds of skimmed-milk powder, as referred to in category II of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 174/1999, relating to those small quantities, to exempt exporters from the obligation of an export licence. 
(5) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
