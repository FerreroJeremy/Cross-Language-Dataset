Whereas pure-bred animals, as live animals, are included in the list in Annex II to the Treaty; 
Whereas rules harmonized at Community level rating to the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade or the marketing of all animals, particularly the bovine, porcine, ovine and caprine species and equidae, have been drawn up; 
Whereas, in this context, the Council has adopted Directive 77/504/EEC of 25 July 1977 on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species (4), Directive 88/661/EEC of 19 December 1988 on the zootechnical standards applicable to breeding animals of the porcine species (5), Directive 89/361/EEC of 30 May 1989 concerning pure-bred sheep and goats (6), Directive 90/427/EEC of 26 June 1990 on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae (7) and Directive 91/174/EEC of 25 March 1991 laying down zootechnical and pedigree requirements for the marketing of pure-bred animals (8); 
Whereas, in order especially to ensure rational development of the rearing of pure-bred livestock and thus increase productivity in this sector, principles should be laid down at Community level relating to the zootechnical and genealogical conditions applicable to the importation of these animals, their semen, ova and embryos from third countries; 
Whereas provision should be made for Council Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (9) and Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries (10) to apply to the animals and products referred to in this Directive;
