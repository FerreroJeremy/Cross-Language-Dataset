Proposal for a 
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
establishing common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities and for their calculation and dissemination 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. Why a Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) regulation? 
PPPs are currency conversion rates that convert economic indicators expressed in national currencies to a common currency and, at the same time, take account of price level differences and thus allow pure volume comparisons of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its aggregates between countries. 
The purpose of a PPP Regulation would be to codify what is already being done by the European Union (EU) Member States and Eurostat to calculate annual PPPs, and hence to give the work a statutory basis. It would not of itself call for any new work to be done, except to introduce new elements of quality control; nor would it seek to encompass other matters, such as price comparisons in general. 
The Structural Funds Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, gives statutory responsibility to the Commission for calculating GDP on a purchasing power basis. A new legal act in this domain provides the opportunity to clarify the role and responsibilities of national authorities in compiling these statistics and transmitting them to Eurostat. 
The setting-up of a legal basis for PPPs should improve the transparency, timeliness and quality of the entire process of PPP production, both within the national statistical institutes (NSIs) and in Eurostat. The use of a Regulation as a means of improving PPP quality overall may be seen as a target not only for Eurostat as producer of the co-ordinated results, but also for the countries themselves. 
2. Economic background 
2.1 GDP comparisons 
GDP, which is one of the vital national accounts aggregates, represents in a concise form the results of all activities of economic operators within a given economic territory and within a given period, usually a year. GDP is calculated in accordance with a system of national accounts which, for the EU, is the European system of integrated economic accounts 1995 (ESA-95). GDP and its aggregates are essential indicators for macroeconomic analysis and economic policy. GDP can be measured from the production, the expenditure and the income side. For PPP purposes the expenditure measure is particularly important. It reveals the extent to which the goods and services produced (or imported) by the economy of a country are used for private consumption, public consumption, capital formation or export. 
International comparisons of economic aggregates such as GDP require firstly that the basis for measuring the aggregates is consistent for the countries under comparison, and secondly that a comparable unit of measurement is employed. Consistency in the basis for measuring the aggregates is achieved through compliance with ESA95. 
The differences in GDP expenditure values between countries correspond not only to a “volume of goods and services” component but also to a “level of prices” component, which can sometimes assume sizeable proportions (value is the product of price and volume). In order to obtain a real comparison of volumes, therefore, it is essential to use conversion factors (spatial deflators) which reflect the differences in the level of prices between countries. 
The use of exchange rates as conversion factors does not allow such a real comparison of the volumes of goods and services produced and used in the different countries. This is because exchange rates are determined by the many factors which affect demand and supply for currencies, such as international trade and interest rate differentials. In other words, exchange rates usually reflect elements other than price differences alone. 
PPPs between various countries’ currencies have been specifically developed to be appropriate for use as spatial conversion factors. 
2.2 What are PPPs? 
PPPs are currency conversion rates that convert economic indicators, expressed in nominal national currencies, to a common artificial currency called Purchasing Power Standard (PPS), which equalises the purchasing power of different national currencies and thus allows meaningful pure volume comparison of GDP and its aggregates between countries. In other words, PPPs are both price deflators and currency converters; they remove the differences in price levels between countries in the process of conversion. 
Economic volume aggregates in PPS are obtained by dividing their original value in national currency units by the respective PPP. 1 PPS buys the same given volume of goods and services in all countries, whereas different amounts of national currency units are needed to buy the same volume of goods and services in individual countries, depending on the national price level. Thus, GDPs of countries expressed in PPS by using PPPs as conversion factors reflect a pure volume comparison, since the price level component has been eliminated. 
With the launch of the euro in the euro-zone Member States, for the first time prices can be compared directly between those countries. However, the euro has different purchasing power in the individual euro-zone countries, depending on the national price levels. Therefore, in order to determine pure volume aggregates in PPS it is still necessary to calculate PPPs. In other words, for the non-euro-zone countries PPPs are currency converters and eliminate the effects of different price levels, while for the euro-zone countries they fulfil only the latter, price-deflator function. 
In an annual multilateral exercise, PPPs are obtained as the averages of the price ratios between the different countries for a basket of comparable goods and services. These are selected to represent an entire set of well-defined expenditure classifications, and to be representative of consumption patterns in the various countries. 
3. Uses of PPPs in the Commission 
3.1 Structural and Cohesion Funds 
The reform of the Structural Funds, and their extension to new Member States, has been embodied in Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and in Annex II to the 2003 Act of Accession, of which Section 15 is entitled “Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments”. The first of these lays down general provisions on the Structural Funds for the current period, stating that regions whose per capita GDP measured in PPPs is less than 75% of the Community average are eligible for Structural Funds allocations. It also says that the criteria are to be calculated using objective statistical data. It may be assumed that similar provisions would govern the following period, beginning in 2007. The second of these acts amends those principles to cover new Member States too. 
This new legal basis contrasts with the previous situation, in which the only statutory reference to PPPs in relation to the Structural Funds was in the recital of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88, which simply stated: “Whereas [. . .] this list should comprise administrative level NUTS II regions where per capita GDP measured in terms of purchasing power parity is less than 75% of the Community average, . . . ”. There was no implementing clause in the body of the Regulation. Currently, the Structural Funds requirements are met by combining regional GDP values and national PPPs. 
The Regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund (Council Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 of 25 May 1994) states that it is the Community’s task to promote economic and social cohesion and solidarity between the Member States, and Cohesion Fund is an instrument to accomplish this. Article 2(1) of the Regulation states that: “the Fund shall provide financial contributions to projects, which contribute to achieving the objectives laid down in the Treaty on European Union, in the fields of environment and trans-European infrastructure networks in Member States with a per capita gross national product (GNP), measured in purchasing power parity, of less than 90% of the Community average.” Therefore, the Cohesion Fund Regulation, too, gives to the Commission the statutory responsibility for calculating purchasing power parities. 
3.2 Correction coefficients 
Although the Regulation focuses on the specific aim of obtaining price data for making international GDP comparisons, it is also a means of establishing a statutory basis for the price collection activity which is necessary in order to fulfil a large part of the Commission's legal requirements in connection with Article 64 of the Staff Regulations. In other words, the prices collected in the realm of the PPP exercise are also used for establishing the correction coefficients to be applied to the remuneration and pensions of officials and other servants of the European Communities in accordance with the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities. Article 1 of Annex XI of the Staff Regulations requires that “the economic parities shall be calculated in such a way that each basic component can be checked by a direct survey at least once every five years”. 
3.3 Price comparisons 
There is a growing need within the Commission for data concerning spatial price comparisons – particularly for consumer prices. This requirement is prompted by a number of policy needs, in particular the monitoring of price convergence in the Single Market, the improvement of price indicators to monitor the functioning of public procurement markets and the monitoring of price convergence in the euro-zone since the introduction of the euro. Price level indices at the level of overall private household consumption, coming from the PPP exercise, already feature as Structural Indicators in the Commission’s Communication on Structural Indicators and Commission’s annual Synthesis Report to the European Council. 
From the point of view of consumer protection, there is also a need to monitor price differences for a wide range of consumer products across the EU. A substantial part of these requirements, particularly at more aggregated level, can be met as a by-product of the wider PPP programme. 
Thus, price comparisons are of special importance for several Community policies, such as development of the single market and monitoring of the EMU with regard to convergence of prices and consumer protection concerning the identification of price differences. The PPP work programme, as outlined in this proposed Regulation, would not necessarily provide all the data required for these other uses, but it would at least put in place a framework which could be used as a basis for additional price comparison work. Moreover, nothing in this Regulation prevents the Commission from investigating and studying new alternative sources of price data. These kinds of studies are currently being undertaken in the Commission to investigate the appropriateness of bar-code scanner data and the Internet as a source for international price comparisons. 
4. Conclusions 
Economic aggregates converted into a common currency using PPPs have a wide range of uses in the Commission. PPPs are economically and politically vital indicators for the EU. 
The Commission has a statutory responsibility for calculating GDP on a purchasing power basis; however, the Member States currently have no legal obligation to co-operate. Given that the very nature of this work is multilateral, if only one country withdrew its support the validity of the whole exercise would be impaired. It is therefore important to provide a stable, binding and reliable legal framework capable of ensuring the timely availability of these data.

Proposal for a 
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
establishing common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities and for their calculation and dissemination 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[3], 
Whereas: 
1. In order to obtain a comparison of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in volume terms between Member States, there is an essential need for the Community to have Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) which reflect the differences in the level of prices between Member States. 
2. The Community PPPs need to be produced in accordance with a harmonised methodology, consistent with Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community[4], (ESA 95) which lays down a framework for the construction of national accounts in the Member States. 
3. Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds[5], – must be read in conjunction with Part 15 of Annex II of the 2003 Act of Accession, entitled “Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments”. That Article 3(1) states that the regions covered by Objective 1 are to be regions corresponding to level II of NUTS whose per capita GDP, measured in PPPs and calculated on the basis of Community figures, is less than 75% of the Community average. In the absence of regional PPPs, national PPPs should serve to establish the list of regions which could benefit from the Structural Funds; they can also be used to determine the amount of funds to be allocated to each region. 
4. Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 of 16 May 1994 establishing a Cohesion Fund[6], – must be read in conjunction with Part 15 of Annex II of the 2003 Act of Accession, entitled “Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments”. That Article 2(1) states that the Fund shall provide financial contributions to projects, which contribute to achieving the objectives laid down in the Treaty on European Union, in the fields of the environment and trans-European transport infrastructure networks in Member States with a per capita gross national product (GNP), measured in purchasing power parities, of less than 90 % of the Community average which have a programme leading to the fulfilment of the conditions of economic convergence referred to in Article 104c of the Treaty. 
5. Article 1 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities states that, for the purposes of the review provided for in Article 65(1) of the Staff Regulations, Eurostat must draw up every year before the end of October a report on changes in the cost of living in Brussels, the economic parities between Brussels and certain places in the Member States, and changes in the purchasing power of salaries in national civil services in central government. 
6. The existing methodologies and practices operating within the European Union, at present governed as individual statistical programmes by Council Regulation (EC) No 322/1997 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics,[7] need in future to be put into a legal framework. 
7. The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[8]. 
8. The Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities [9], has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

3. PPPs shall be calculated according to the basic headings as listed in Annex II, consistent with the related GDP classifications defined in Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996. 
Article 3 
Definitions 
For the purpose of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: 
(a) “Purchasing Power Parities” or “PPPs” means spatial deflators and currency converters, which eliminate the effects of the differences in price levels between countries, thus allowing volume comparisons of GDP components and comparisons of price levels. 
(b) "PPS” (Purchasing Power Standard) means the artificial common reference currency unit used in the European Union to express the volume of economic aggregates for the purpose of spatial comparisons in such a way that price level differences between countries are eliminated.

ANNEX I METHODOLOGY 
1. Methodological Manual and Work Programme 
1.1 A METHODOLOGICAL MANUAL SHALL BE PROVIDED BY THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT), FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE MEMBER STATES, DESCRIBING THE METHODS USED AT THE VARIOUS STAGES OF COMPILING PPPS, INCLUDING THE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING MISSING BASIC INFORMATION AND FOR ESTIMATING MISSING PARITIES. THE METHODOLOGICAL MANUAL WILL BE REVISED WHENEVER A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE METHODOLOGY IS MADE. IT MAY INTRODUCE NEW METHODS TO IMPROVE DATA QUALITY, REDUCE COSTS OR lessen the burden on data suppliers. 
1.2 The Commission (Eurostat) shall establish, by 31 October of each year, in consultation with Member States, an annual Work Programme for the following calendar year setting out the timetable for the specification and the provision of the basic information required for that year 
1.3 The annual Work Programme shall determine the format for provision of data to be used by the Member States, and any other actions necessary in order to accomplish the calculation and publication of PPPs. 
1.4 The basic information supplied according to paragraph 1.2. may be revised, but the results for the reference year shall be calculated from information available according to the timetable specified in Article 9. Where information is not complete or not available at that date, the Commission (Eurostat) shall estimate the missing basic information. 
2. BASIC INFORMATION 
2.1 BASIC INFORMATION ITEMS 
For the purpose of this Regulation, the Basic Information according to Articles 2 and 4 and the minimum frequency of new data supply shall be: 
Basic Information | Minimum Frequency | 
GDP expenditure values | Annual | 
Actual and imputed rentals | Annual | 
Compensation of employees | Annual | 
Temporal adjustment factors | Annual | 
Prices of consumer goods and services and related representativity indicators | 3 years1 | 
Prices of equipment goods | 3 years | 
Prices of construction projects | 3 years | 
Spatial adjustment factors | 6 years | 
1) The minimum frequency refers to the provision of data for a particular product group, related to the rolling cycle of surveys. 
2.2 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING BASIC INFORMATION 
The Commission (Eurostat), after taking account of the views of the Member States, shall determine the sources and data suppliers to be used for each of the above items of Basic Information. If the Commission (Eurostat) obtains basic information from a data supplier other than a Member State, the latter shall be relieved of the obligations set forth in paragraphs 5.1.4 to 5.1.13. 
3. NATIONAL AVERAGE PRICES 
3.1 NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2(2), DATA COLLECTION MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE OR MORE LOCATIONS WITHIN THE ECONOMIC TERRITORY. SUCH DATA MAY BE USED FOR PPP CALCULATIONS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE SPATIAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THESE SHALL BE USED TO ADJUST SURVEY DATA IN THESE LOCATIONS TO THOSE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. 
3.2 Spatial adjustment factors shall be supplied at basic heading level. They shall not be more than six years old at the reference period of the survey. 
4. Annual average prices 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2(2), DATA COLLECTION MAY BE LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME. SUCH DATA MAY BE USED FOR PPP CALCULATIONS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE TEMPORAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THESE SHALL BE USED TO ADJUST SURVEY DATA IN THIS PERIOD TO THOSE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ANNUAL AVERAGE.

5.1.1 The list of items to be priced shall be designed to comprise items whose specifications ensure comparability between countries. 
5.1.2 The list of items to be priced shall be designed so that each Member State can indicate at least one representative item, which can be priced in at least one other country for each basic heading. 
5.1.3 The item list shall be designed in order to achieve the highest practicable level of equi-representativity, so that as a minimum, each country has to price one representative item for each basic heading and this representative item has to be priced by at least one other country. 
5.1.4 Each Member State shall price items according to the specifications in the item list. 
5.1.5 Each Member State shall price a sufficient number of items within each basic heading that are available in its market, even though they may not be considered as representative of that basic heading. 
5.1.6 Each Member State shall supply prices of at least one representative item within each basic heading. The representative items shall be indicated by a representativity indicator. 
5.1.7 Each Member State shall collect a sufficient number of price quotations for each item priced to ensure a reliable average price per item taking account of its market structure. 
5.1.8 The selection of outlet types shall be designed to adequately reflect the domestic pattern of consumption within the Member State according to the item. 
5.1.9 The outlet selection in a location shall be designed to adequately reflect the pattern of consumption of the residents of the location and the availability of items. 
5.1.10 Each Member State shall supply the Commission (Eurostat) with data on compensation of employees for selected occupations with reference to the sector General Government (S 13) as defined in ESA95.

7.1 CALCULATION OF BILATERAL PARITIES AT BASIC HEADING LEVEL 
a) The calculation of multilateral EKS (Èltetò-Köves-Szulc) parities at basic heading level shall be based on a matrix of bilateral parities for each pair of participant countries. 
b) The calculation of bilateral parities shall be carried out by reference to the prices observed for, and the representativity indicators attributed to, the underlying items. 
c) The average survey price for each item shall be established as the simple arithmetic mean of the price observations recorded for that item. 
d) The national annual average price shall be estimated, where necessary, on the basis of the average survey price by using appropriate spatial and temporal adjustment factors. 
e) The ratios of the adjusted average prices shall then be calculated, where possible, for items and pairs of participant countries, together with their inverse. 
f) A PPP shall then be calculated, where possible, for all pairs of participant countries for the basic heading. For each pair of participant countries, the PPP shall be calculated as the weighted geometric mean of 
- the geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of both countries; 
- the geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of the first country but not of the second country; 
- the geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of the second country but not of the first country; 
using weights reflecting the relative representativity of all items priced by both countries. 
7.2 ESTIMATION OF MISSING BILATERAL PARITIES 
If for any basic heading the bilateral PPP cannot be calculated, the missing bilateral PPPs shall be estimated, where possible, by using the standard procedure of geometric averaging of indirect parities via third countries. Should the matrix of bilateral PPPs for a basic heading still contain any missing values after this estimation procedure, the calculation of multilateral EKS parities shall then not be possible for the countries for which bilateral PPPs are missing. Such missing "EKS" parities shall then be estimated by the Commission (Eurostat), using reference PPPs from similar basic headings or any other appropriate estimation method 
7.3 THE CALCULATION OF BILATERAL PARITIES AT AGGREGATE LEVEL 
a) The calculation of bilateral parities at a particular level of national accounts aggregation shall be carried out using the “EKS” parities (see paragraph 7.4), and the GDP expenditure values for, the underlying basic headings. 
b) A Laspeyres-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the arithmetic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the second country of each pair of participant countries. 
c) A Paasche-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the harmonic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the first country of each pair of participant countries. 
d) A Fisher-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the geometric mean of the Laspeyres-type and Paasche-type parities established for each pair of participant countries. 
7.4 CALCULATION OF TRANSITIVE MULTILATERAL PPPS 
The calculation of multilateral transitive parities shall be carried out either at basic heading level or any aggregated level by using the “EKS” procedure based on a complete matrix of Fisher-type parities between each pair of participant countries as follows: 
[pic] 
where [pic]denotes the EKS parity between country s and country t ; 
[pic] denotes the Fisher-type parity between country s and country t ; 
z denotes the number of participant countries. 
8. Transmission 
8.1 THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) SHALL SUPPLY TO THE MEMBER STATES THE TEMPLATES FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF THE BASIC INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CALCULATE PPPS. 
8.2 Member States shall provide basic information to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the templates. 
9. Publication 
IN ADDITION TO THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 9(2), THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) MAY PUBLISH RESULTS AT A MORE DETAILED LEVEL AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE MEMBER STATES. 
10. Corrections 
10.1 WHEN A MISTAKE IS DISCOVERED BY A MEMBER STATE IT SHALL IMMEDIATELY AND AT ITS OWN INITIATIVE PROVIDE THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) WITH CORRECT BASIC INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, A MEMBER STATE SHALL INFORM THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) OF ANY SUSPECTED INAPPROPRIATE APPLICATION OF THE CALCULATION PROCEDURE. 
10.2 After becoming aware of a mistake, made either by a Member State or the Commission (Eurostat), the Commission (Eurostat) shall inform the Member States and recalculate the PPPs within one month. 
10.3 If the mistakes discovered result in a change of at least 0.5 percentage points at the level of per capita GDP in PPS of any Member State, the Commission (Eurostat) shall publish a correction as soon as possible, unless such mistakes are discovered later than three months after the results have been published. 
10.4 Where a mistake has occurred, the responsible body shall take steps to prevent similar future occurrences. 
10.5 Revisions made after 21 months following the end of the reference year to GDP expenditure values or to population estimates shall not require a correction to be made to PPP results.

Method of Implementation (indicative) 
Centralised Management by the Commission 
MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
Monitoring system 
The implementation of the Regulation will be monitored using standardised reports that describe national methods and practices. The reports will be done at six years intervals. Country reports are assessed by the Commission. 
The PPP price surveys are also monitored continuously. The NSIs submit to the Commission a survey report after each survey. 
The implementation of the Regulation and possible technical changes will be done in a Comitology procedure foreseen in article 11 of the Regulation. 
Evaluation 
Ex-ante evaluation 
The Regulation proposal is continuation of existing actions, currently done on a voluntary basis by the Member States 
Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) 
N/A 
Terms and frequency of future evaluation 
The provisions of the Regulation shall be reviewed five years after the date of its entry into force and revised, if appropriate, on the basis of a report transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council and a proposal from the Commission. 
ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES 
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission’s Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capacity. 
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control Standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities. 
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: calls for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments.
