Commission Decision

(notified under document number C(2003) 1635) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2003/380/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat(1), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(2), and in particular Article 13 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with Article 18(3) of Council Directive 72/462/EEC(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001(4), a decision was adopted on 28 January 1991 permitting warm-cutting of bovine and pig carcases under special conditions in certain establishments in Sweden. 
(2) Sweden acceded to the Community with effect as from 1 January 1995. For this reason Directive 72/462/EEC is no longer the appropriate legal basis for a decision allowing for warm-cutting. A new decision should therefore be adopted under Directive 64/433/EEC. 
(3) The authorities of Sweden, by letter of 15 July 2002, have presented to the Commission a request for a derogation from point 46(d) of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC for cutting fresh beef and pigmeat. This request proposes health conditions which are equivalent to those laid down in that paragraph. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Notwithstanding point 46(d) of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC, Sweden may authorise cutting of fresh beef and pigmeat under the conditions laid down in the Annex to this Decision. 
Article 2 
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
