COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1898/97 of 29 September 1997 laying down rules of application in the pigmeat sector for the arrangements covered by Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2698/93 and (EC) No 1590/94 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 (2), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (4), and in particular Article 22 thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 adjusts as an autonomous and transitional measure the agricultural concessions in the Europe Agreements concluded between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part and the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania respectively of the other part, for the period 1 January 1996 to entry into force of the Additional Protocols; whereas these adjustments were extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2490/96 (5) to 31 December 1997; whereas owing to procedural delays the Additional Protocols to the Europe Agreements, negotiation of which are concluded, cannot enter into force on 1 July 1997; whereas Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 has therefore been amended by Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 in order to allow early implementation in the agricultural sector of the negotiation results; 
Whereas, while bearing in mind the provisions of the Interim Agreements intended to guarantee product origin, the arrangements should be operated using import licences; whereas rules on the presentation of licence applications and to the entries to be made on applications and licences are required that differ from those in Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1404/97 (7); whereas licences should be issued following a reflection period and possibly with a common percentage acceptance applied; 
Whereas for the purposes of smooth operation of the arrangements security of ECU 30 per 100 kilograms should be required against import licences; whereas given the risk of speculative misuse of the arrangements where pigmeat is concerned importer access to these products should be precisely regulated; 
Whereas import licences for certain product categories in the pigmeat sector have already been assigned for the period 1 July to 30 September 1997 in line with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1461/97 of 25 July 1997 determining the extent to which applications lodged in July 1997 for import licences for certain pigmeat products under the regime provided for by the Agreements concluded by the Community with the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic can be accepted (8) and with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1462/97 of 25 July 1997 determining the extent to which applications lodged in July 1997 for import licences for certain pigmeat products under the regime provided for by the Agreements concluded by the Community with Bulgaria and Romania can be accepted (9); whereas the quantities available for the period 1 October to 31 December 1997 should be set by reference to the quantities agreed and quotas set for the period 1 July to 31 December 1997; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2698/93 (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 691/97 (11), lays down detailed rules for application in the pigmeat sector of the arrangements provided for in the Interim Agreements between the European Economic Community and Poland, Hungary, and the former Czech and Slovak Federative Republic; whereas since it is replaced by this Regulation it should be repealed; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1590/94 (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 691/97, lays down detailed rules for application in the pigmeat sector of the arrangements provided for in the Interim Agreements between the Community and Bulgaria and Romania; whereas since it is replaced by this Regulation it should be repealed; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,
