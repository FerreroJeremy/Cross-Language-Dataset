ANNEX 
Description of the goods | Classification CN code | Reasons | 
(1) | (2) | (3) | 
Self-coloured lightweight garment made from knitted fabrics of man-made fibres (90 % polyamide, 10 % elastomeric yarn) intended to cover the lower part of the body from the waist to above the mid-thigh area, enclosing each leg separately, with an opening at the front without any closing system and without an opening at the waist. The garment has an elasticated waist band and is hemmed at the leg ends. There are patch pockets on both sides of the garment, having a zip fastening system and holding a mass-produced removable, oval insert. The inserts are made of a hard plastic material on the outside and are padded with foam on the inside. They are designed to prevent injuries to the hips in case of a fall. They absorb shocks to the hip area of the body. (men's underpants) (See photographs No 636 A + B + C) [1] | 61071200 | Classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1, 3(b) and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the first paragraph of Note 9 to Chapter 61 and the wording of CN code 6107 and 61071200. The inserts are designed to prevent injuries to the hips in case of a fall. Therefore, the garment cannot be classified in heading 9021 as %quot%orthopaedic appliance%quot%, because the inserts neither prevent bodily deformities nor do they support or hold parts of the body within the meaning of the first paragraph of Note 6 to Chapter 90. The article lacks the essential characteristics of the goods covered by Chapter 90, i.e. a high %quot%finish of their manufacture and a high degree of precision%quot% in the way they operate (see paragraph 37 of the Judgment of European Court of Justice in joined cases C-260/00 to C-263/00 of 7 November 2002 and see also the first paragraph of the HS Explanatory Notes to Chapter 90, General, Part (I)). Moreover, the inserts are neither made to measure nor are they adjustable to fit a wearer's specific morphology, which makes the garment an %quot%ordinary product%quot% and, as such, it is excluded from heading 9021 by virtue of paragraph 37 of abovementioned Judgment. This is a composite article consisting of textile underpants and plastic inserts. It is designed as underpants that also provide protection against certain injuries. Thus, within the meaning of General Rule 3(b) the essential character is given by the underpants and not by the inserts. The garment is classified as men's or boys' garment within the meaning of the first paragraph of Note 9 to Chapter 61, because its cut (especially the particular form of the opening at the front) indicates clearly that the garment is designed for men. |
