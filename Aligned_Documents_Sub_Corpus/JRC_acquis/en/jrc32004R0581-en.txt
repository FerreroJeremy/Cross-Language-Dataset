of 26 March 2004 
opening a standing invitation to tender for export refunds concerning certain types of butter

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 31(3)(b) and (14) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) According to Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 580/2004 of 26 March 2004 establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products(2) the Commission decides on a standing invitation to tender within the framework of that Regulation. 
(2) For practical reasons it is appropriate to provide for separate invitations to tender for the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 580/2004. This Regulation should therefore open a standing invitation to tender for certain types of butter.
