Whereas: 
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products in the Community may be covered by an export refund.

(5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period. 
(6) It follows from applying the detailed rules set out above to the present situation on the market in cereals, and in particular to quotations or prices for these products within the Community and on the world market, that the refunds should be as set out in the Annex hereto. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
