Commission Regulation (EC) No 1695/2005 
of 17 October 2005

(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 [2] lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 [3] lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention. 
(3) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 500000 tonnes of common wheat held by the French intervention agency. 
(4) Special rules must be laid down to ensure that the operations are properly carried out and monitored. To that end, securities should be lodged to ensure that the goals of the operation are achieved without excessive cost to the operators. Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
(5) To forestall reimportation, exports under this invitation to tender should be limited to certain third countries. 
(6) With a view to modernising the management of the system, provision should be made for the electronic transmission of the information required by the Commission.

The intervention agency, the storer and a successful tenderer shall, at the request of the latter and by common agreement, either before or at the time of removal from storage as the tenderer chooses, take reference samples for counter-analysis at the rate of at least one sample for every 500 tonnes and shall analyse the samples. The intervention agency may be represented by a proxy, provided this is not the storer. 
Reference samples for counter-analysis shall be taken and analysed within seven working days of the date of the successful tenderer's request or within three working days if the samples are taken on removal from storage. 
In the event of a dispute, the analysis results shall be forwarded electronically to the Commission. 
Article 7 
1. The successful tenderer must accept the lot as established if the final result of the sample analyses indicates a quality: 
(a) higher than that specified in the notice of invitation to tender; 
(b) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, providing that the differences having regard to those criteria do not exceed the following limits: 
- one kilogram per hectolitre as regards specific weight, which must not, however, be less than 75 kg/hl, 
- one percentage point as regards moisture content, 
- half a percentage point as regards the impurities specified in points B.2 and B.4 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 [6], and half a percentage point as regards the impurities referred to in point B.5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 824/2000, the admissible percentages for noxious grains and ergot remaining unchanged, however.

(a) accept the lot as established, or

Article 8

The successful tenderer shall immediately inform the Commission thereof using the form in Annex I. 
If, following successive replacements, the successful tenderer has not received a replacement lot of the quality laid down within one month of the date of the request for a replacement, the successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations and the securities shall be released, provided the Commission and the intervention agency have been immediately informed using the form in Annex I. 
Article 9 
1. If the common wheat is removed before the results of the analyses provided for in Article 6 are known, all risks shall be borne by the successful tenderer from the time the lot is removed, without prejudice to any means of redress the tenderer might have against the storer. 
2. The costs of taking the samples and conducting the analyses provided for in Article 6, with the exception of those referred to in Article 7(3), shall be borne by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) for up to one analysis per 500 tonnes, with the exception of the cost of inter-bin transfers. The costs of inter-bin transfers and any additional analyses requested by a successful tenderer shall be borne by that tenderer. 
Article 10 
Notwithstanding Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92, the documents relating to the sale of common wheat under this Regulation, and in particular the export licence, the removal order referred to in Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92, the export declaration and, where applicable, the T5 copy shall carry one of the entries set out in Annex II.
