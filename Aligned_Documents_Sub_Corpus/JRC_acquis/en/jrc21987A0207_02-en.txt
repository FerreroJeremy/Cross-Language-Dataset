PART II SPECIFIC PROVISIONS 
1. WHOLE HUMAN BLOOD 
Whole human blood is blood which has been mixed with a suitable anticoagulant, after collection from a human subject in normal health. 
The blood shall not be obtained from a human subject: 
(a) who is known to be suffering from or to have suffered from syphilis ; 
or 
(b) whose blood has not been tested with negative results for evidence of syphilitic infection ; 
or 
(c) who is not, as far as can be ascertained after medical examination and the study of his antecedents, free from disease transmissible by blood transfusion. 
The blood shall be withdrawn aseptically through a closed system of sterile tubing into a sterile container in which the anticoagulant solution has been placed before the container is sterilized. The equipment used must be pyrogen-free. When withdrawal is complete the container shall be immediately sealed and cooled to 4 to 6 C and not opened thereafter until immediately before the blood is to be used. 
The blood will be collected into a citrate solution of acid reaction containing dextrose. No antiseptic or bacteriostatic substance shall be added. The volume of the anticoagulant solution must not exceed 220 ml per litre of the whole human blood and the haemoglobin concentration must not less than 97 grams per litre. 
Blood group 
The blood group under the AB0 system shall have been determined by examination of both corpuscles and serum and that under the Rh system by examination of the corpuscles, using a separate sample of the donor's blood. When there is a national standard, or nationally recommended technique of blood grouping, that technique shall be used. 
The term Rh negative is only to be used when specific tests have shown the absence of the antigens C, D, Du and E. All other blood must be labelled Rh positive. 
Blood exchange under this agreement should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB0 group.

ANNEX II TO THE PROTOCOL COUNCIL OF EUROPE EUROPEAN AGREEMENT ON THE EXCHANGE OF THERAPEUTIC SUBSTANCES OF HUMAN ORIGIN FREEDOM FROM TOXICITY OF PLASTIC BLOOD-TRANSFUSION EQUIPMENT 
I. CHEMICAL TESTS 
The tests are intended to be applied to plastic blood-transfusion equipment. This equipment consists of two main categories: 
1. plastic containers for the collection, separation and storage of blood and blood products; 
2. plastic sets for taking and giving blood. 
The tests shall be carried out on the materials after they have been sterilized by the method to be used in the final sterilization of the equipment. These materials shall include: 
1. the plastics used to make the containers; 
2. the tubing used in the containers ; and 
3. the blood-taking and -giving sets. 
The tests on containers shall be carried out before the containers are filled with anticoagulant solution. However, if the tests are carried out on containers which have been filled with anticoagulant solution, the limit tests in Section III on the anticoagulant solution itself shall be taken into account when evaluating the results of the tests on the container. 
The manufacturer of the transfusion equipment is required to disclose to the appropriate health authority the detailed formulations of the plastic material or materials and other materials used in the manufacture of the equipment, the source of the components of the material or materials and their methods of manufacture (or alternatively, the compound reference numbers), details of manufacture of the equipment, the nature of any processing additives and adhesives and the method of sterilization. No change shall be permitted in any of the foregoing without prior submission to and approval of the appropriate health authority. 
Each batch of raw material used in the manufacture of the equipment shall be identified by a batch numer, which shall be recorded by the manufacturer of the equipment together with the identification numbers of all batches of transfusion equipment made from it and the results of all tests relevant to these batches. 
Every practicable precaution must be taken to reduce the risk of adventitious contamination at each stage of the manufacturing process. 
A. Preparation of extract and blank 
(a) A total test as decribed below requires 1 250 cm2 plastic (total surface area, both sides, of a plastic sample in sheet form with surface area of 625 cm2). The sample - without any printing or label on it - should be cut into pieces of not more than 10 cm2. 
For tubing the length (L) in cm is calculated as follows: 
Where: 
D1 = inner diameter in cm, 
D2 = outer diameter in cm. 
The tubing should be cut lengthwise into sections measuring approximately 10 cm. For the extraction 10 ml of water is used per 50 cm2 of surface area. 
(b) The pieces of plastic film or tubing should be placed in a container of borosilicate glass with 250 ml pyrogen-free distilled water obtained from an efficient still having glass condensation surfaces and collecting tubes (1). The opening of the container is covered with an inverted beaker and the container is then heated in saturated steam at 110 C for 30 minutes (autoclaving) and then quickly cooled to room temperature and the volume adjusted to 250 ml with pyrogen-free distilled water. It is of no significance if the plastic specimens tend to stick together slightly. 
(1) If the plastic has been in contact with an anticoagulant solution, the pieces should first be placed in a similar container with cold distilled water (100 ml) and shaken several times. This should be repeated once. 
Heat-sensitive plastic material, instead of being heated in an autoclave, may be heated at 70 C for 72 hours. 
A blank preparation is made in a corresponding manner omitting the plastic. 
B. Tests on the extract 
1. Oxidizable matter 
To 20 ml of the extract in an Erlenmeyer flask of borosilicate glass add 20 ml of 2 millimole potassium permanganate solution per litre and 1,0 ml of 1 mole sulphuric acid per litre and boil the mixture for three minutes. Cool the solution rapidly and add 0,1 g of potassium iodide and five drops of starch solution. Titrate with a solution containing 10 millimole sodium thiosulphate per litre. At the same time carry out a blank titration. The difference in the volume of thiosulphate used in the two titrations does not exceed 2,00 ml of a solution containing 10 millimole sodium thiosulphate per litre. 
2. Chloride 
The extract complies with a suitable limit test for chloride equivalent to not more than 11,2 ¶mole chloride per litre. 
3. Ammonia 
The extract complies with a suitable limit test for ammonia equivalent to not more than 120 ¶mole NH3 per litre. 
4. Phosphoric acid - phosphate 
The extract complies with the limit test for phosphate. 
Limit test for phosphate 
Evaporate 25 ml of the extract almost to dryness in a Kjeldahl flask, cool the residue, add two drops sulphuric acid and 1 ml nitric acid, heat the mixture until white fumes appear, then cool. Add one drop of perchloric acid and heat gently for half an hour. Cool the residue and add water to 25 ml. Transfer 10 ml of the solution to a 25 ml titration flask, add 8 ml ammonium molybdate-sulphuric acid solution and 2 ml of freshly prepared solution of ascorbic acid, having a concentration of 100 g/l. Heat on a water bath at 50 C for 30 minutes, cool and dilute the mixture to 25 ml. The green or blue colour of the solution is not more intense than that obtained by treating 25 ml of the blank solution in the same manner. 
5. Acidity or alkalinity 
10 ml of the extract is not coloured red on the addition of two drops of phenolphthalein solution and requires not more than 0,4 ml solution containing 10 millimole sodium hydroxide per litre to produce a red colour. After removal of the colour by the addition of 0,08 ml solution containing 10 millimole hydrochloric acid per litre, the addition of five drops of methyl red solution produces a red or orange-red colour. 
6. Residue on evaporation 
Evaporate 100 ml of the extract to dryness on a water bath and dry at 105 C to constant weight. The residue weighs not more than 5,0 mg. 
7. Clarity and colour 
The extract when viewed through a thickness of 5 cm is clear and colourless when compared with the blank. 
8. Taste and smell 
The extract compared with the blank is odourless and tasteless. 
9. Special elements 
The extract complies with suitable limit tests for: 
(i) any of the following elements : arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, silicon, silver and tin, equivalent to 1 g/g; 
(ii) cadmium, equivalent to 0,1 g/g. 
10. Residue on ignition 
1,0 g of the plastic material when ignited to constant weight leaves not more than 1 mg of residue. 
11. Heavy metals 
Dissolve the residue on ignition in the minimum quantity of a solution of 2 mole hydrochloric acid per litre, heating if necessary. Carry out a suitable limit test for heavy metals. The plastic material complies with a limit not exceeding 5 micrograms per gram as calculated as Pb. 
II. BIOLOGICAL TESTS 
1. A test for undue toxicity shall be carried out in the initial evaluation of plastic formulations intended for the fabrication of containers and taking- and giving-sets, using extract A, and on each new batch of materials of the approved formulations, using extract B, by the procedure specified in the national pharmacopoeia or some other method approved by the national control authority. (Extracts A and B are defined in the note below.) 
2. A test for freedom from pyrogens shall be carried out in the initial evaluation of plastic formulations intended for the fabrication of containers and taking- and giving-sets, using extract A, and on each new batch of materials of the approved formulation, using extract C, and in the routine control of containers and taking- and giving-sets, using extract C, by the procedure specified in the national pharmacopoeia or some other method approved by the national control authority. 
The incidence of pyrogen testing, using extract C, shall be decided by the national control authority. (Extracts A and C are defined in the note below.) 
3. A test for haemolytic effects in buffered systems shall be performed in the initial evaluation of plastic formulations intended for the fabrication of containers and taking- and giving-sets and on each new batch of materials of the approved formulations using the extract described in paragraph I. A above. (For method and acceptable limit, see Appendix to the present Annex.) 
4. A test for the in vivo survival of red cells shall be carried out in the initial evaluation of plastic formulations intended for the fabrication of containers for blood. If any change is made in the agreed formulation, the test shall be repeated. (For suggested methods and acceptable limit, see Appendix to the present Annex.) 
Note: 
Extract A 
is prepared by adding to the extract described in I. A above pyrogen-free sodium chloride to a final concentration of 9 grams per litre. 
Extract B: 
Transfusion set. Fill a transfusion set as completely as possible with sterile pyrogen-free solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre, clamp the ends securely and immerse the filled set completely for one hour in water maintained at 85 C. 
Plastic container. If the container is filled with anti-coagulant solution it should be emptied and rinsed twice with 250-ml portions of sterile pyrogen-free distilled water at a temperature of 20 C. Fill the container with 100 ml sterile pyrogen-free solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre, close it securely and immerse it for one hour in a horizontal position in water maintained at 85 C. Collect the contents of the container. 
Extract C: 
Transfusion set. Pass 40-ml portions of sterile pyrogen-free sodium chloride solution of a concentration of 9 grams per litre, at room temperature through not less than 10 transfusion sets at a flow rate of approximately 10 ml per minute and pool the effluents. Test the solution obtained. 
Plastic container. Empty. Pass 100-ml portions of sterile pyrogen-free solution containing 9,0 grams sodium chloride per litre, at room temperature through the collecting tubes of not less than four plastic containers, allow to remain in the containers for 10 minutes and pool the effluent by discharging through the transfer tubes. Test the solution obtained. 
Plastic container with anticoagulant (See paragraph III). 
III. REQUIREMENTS FOR ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION IN PLASTICS CONTAINERS 
Each container shall contain the quantity and formulation of anticoagulant solution indicated on the label for the volume of blood to be collected. 
The anticoagulant solution and/or the ingredients used in its preparation shall satisfy the requirements of the national pharmacopoeia of the country concerned. 
The anticoagulant solution shall satisfy the requirements of the national pharmacopoeia of the country concerned with regard to limits for heavy metals, the absence of particulate matter, freedom from toxicity and pyrogenicity.

BIOLOGICAL TEST : LIMITS AND METHODS 
A. Test for undue toxicity 
(See Item II, 1 of Annex above) : limit as specified in national pharmacopoeia. 
B. Test for freedom from pyrogens 
(See Item II, 2 of Annex above) : limit as specified in national pharmacopoeia. 
C. Test for haemolytic effects in buffered systems 
(See Item II, 3 of Annex above): 
(a) Limit: 
A salt solution equivalent to a solution containing 5,0 grams NaCl per litre, in so far as electrolyte osmotic action is concerned, shall not produce a haemolysis value higher than 10 % and a salt solution of 4,0 grams per litre shall not differ by more than 10 % in haemolysis value from that caused by the corresponding control solution. 
(b) Method: 
D. Test for the in vivo survival of red cells 
(See Item II, 4 of Annex above): 
(a) Limit: 
Of the erythrocytes on whole human blood with ACD anticoagulant, which has been stored for 21 days at 4 to 6 C, at least 70 % shall have a post-transfusion survival time of 24 hours. This can be determined according to one of the methods proposed in (b) below.
