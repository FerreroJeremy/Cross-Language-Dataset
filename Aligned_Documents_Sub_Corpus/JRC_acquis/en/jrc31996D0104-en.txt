COMMISSION DECISION of 29 January 1996 amending Decision 94/360/EC on the reduced frequency of physical checks of consignments of certain products to be imported from third countries (Text with EEA relevance) (96/104/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (1), as last amended by Directive 95/52/EC (2) and in particular Article 8 (3) thereof, 
Whereas in Decision 94/360/EC (3), as last amended by 95/270/EC (4), the Commission adopted measures on the reduction in frequency of physical checks of consignments of products to be imported form third countries; whereas these frequencies should apply from 1 February 1996, following a review of the frequencies on the basis of the results of all checks on imported consignments of products; 
Whereas further progress is necessary on the harmonization of import conditions on imported products; 
Whereas further experience of Member States checks on consignments is necessary to carry out the review of the frequencies foreseen in Article 3 (3); whereas it is therefore necessary to defer the date of application of the frequencies to 1 January 1997; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
