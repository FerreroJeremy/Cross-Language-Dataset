ANNEX 
1. Point 2.1.4 is replaced by the following: %quot%2.1.4. the static sound level: ... dB(A) ... min-1.%quot% 
2. Point 3.1.1.2 is replaced by the following: %quot%3.1.1.2. the second part consists of six characters (letters or digits) for the purpose of describing the general characteristics of the vehicle (type, variant and version). If the manufacturer does not use one or more of those characters, the unused spaces must be filled by alphanumerical characters, the choice being left to the manufacturer for each vehicle.%quot% 
3. Point 3.1.2 is replaced by the following: %quot%3.1.2. the vehicle identification number must, wherever possible, occupy a single line. The beginning and end of this line must be marked by a symbol which is neither an Arabic numeral nor a capital Latin letter, nor must it be possible to confuse this with any such character. 
By way of an exception and for technical reasons it may also occupy two lines. However, in this case there must be no breaks within any of the three parts and the beginning and end of each line must be marked by a symbol which is neither an Arabic numeral nor a capital Latin letter, nor must it be possible to confuse this with any such character. 
The introduction of said symbol within a line between the three parts (Point 3.1.1) is also authorised. 
There must be no spaces between the characters.%quot%
