THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2931/95 (2), and in particular Articles 7 (5) and 28 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95 (4), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1014/68 of 20 July 1968 laying down general rules for the public storage of skimmed milk powder (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (6), was repealed with effect from 1 March 1996 by Council Regulation (EC) No 1538/95 (7); whereas some of the rules in Regulation (EEC) No 1014/68 have been incorporated into Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1538/95; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 625/78 of 30 March 1978 on detailed rules of application for public storage of skimmed-milk powder (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1802/95 (9), was re-cast when adjusted as a result of the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 1014/68; whereas, consequently, Regulation (EEC) No 625/78 was also repealed with effect from 1 March 1996 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 322/96 of 22 February 1996 laying down detailed rules of application for the public storage of skimmed-milk powder (10); 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1362/87 of 18 May 1987 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 777/87 with respect to the buying-in and the granting of aid for the private storage of skimmed-milk powder (11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1137/94 (12), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1158/91 of 3 May 1991 on the buying in by tender of skimmed-milk powder to intervention agencies (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1802/95, and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 315/96 (15), make reference to Regulations (EEC) No 1014/68 and (EEC) No 625/78; whereas those references should be replaced by references to Regulation (EC) No 322/96; whereas, furthermore, Regulation (EEC) No 1158/91 should be amended to specify the way in which the buying-in price is to be calculated on the basis of the protein content of the skimmed-milk powder; 
Whereas, in respect of the private storage scheme for skimmed milk powder, Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1362/87 provides that, where skimmed-milk powder is for export, notwithstanding the rules normally applicable, the contractor may remove it from storage once a contractual thirty-day period has expired; whereas this derogation is hardly ever used and unnecessarily complicates the administration of the scheme; whereas it should therefore be abolished; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
