Directive 2004/11/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 11 February 2004 
amending Council Directive 92/24/EEC relating to speed limitation devices or similar speed limitation on-board systems of certain categories of motor vehicles 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(1), 
Whereas: 
(1) Measures should be adopted for the purpose of ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market. 
(2) Council Directive 92/24/EEC(2) is one of the separate directives under the Community approval procedure introduced by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(3). The provisions and definitions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC concerning vehicles, vehicles systems, components and separate technical units will thus apply to this Directive. 
(3) Speed limitation devices for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers and for the carriage of goods having a maximum mass exceeding 10 tonnes have shown a positive influence on road safety and reduced the severity of injuries in cases of accidents, while also reducing air pollution and fuel consumption. 
(4) Council Directive 92/6/EEC of 10 February 1992 on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community(4) has been extended to lighter motor vehicles of categories M2 and N2. It is therefore necessary to amend the scope of Directive 92/24/EEC relating to the construction requirements for speed limiters accordingly to cover the same categories of motor vehicles. 
(5) Directive 92/24/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
