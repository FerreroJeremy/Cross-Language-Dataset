Notification by the Republic of Latvia concerning visa reciprocity 
Notification by the Republic of Latvia concerning visa reciprocity [1] 
(2005/C 251/03) 
The Permanent Representation of the Republic of Latvia to the EU presents its compliments to the Secretariat General of the Council of the European Union and has the honour to bring to their attention the following issue. 
Becoming a Member State of the European Union, Latvia unilaterally introduced visa-free regime for the citizens of the Republic of Nicaragua in accordance with EU Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. 
Latvia would like to notify the Council and the Commission that although the Republic of Nicaragua applies visa-free regime to the citizens of Republic of the Latvia, it is required to buy a tourism card upon arrival in the Republic of Nicaragua. Taking into account recital 4 of the Preamble of Council Regulation (EC) No 851/2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement as regards the reciprocity mechanism, this situation can not be admitted as full reciprocity. 
Taking into consideration the abovementioned and in accordance with the solidarity mechanism provided by Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and Regulation (EC) No 851/2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 for achieving full reciprocity in respect to all Member States, Latvia believes that appropriate measures have to be taken in order to assure that all EU citizens may enter the territory of the Republic of Nicaragua under equal conditions. 
The Permanent Representation of the Republic of Latvia to the EU avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Secretariat General of the Council of the European Union assurances of its highest consideration.
