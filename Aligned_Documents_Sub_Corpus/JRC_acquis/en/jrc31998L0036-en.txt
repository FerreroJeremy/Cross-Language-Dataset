COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 98/36/EC of 2 June 1998 amending Directive 96/5/EC on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children (Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (1), as amended by Directive 96/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), and in particular Article 4(1) thereof, 
After consulting the Scientific Committee for Food on the provisions liable to affect public health; 
Whereas the essential compositional criteria for processed cereal-based foods and baby foods are specified in Annexes I and II respectively to Commission Directive 96/5/EC (3); 
Whereas, because of the particular nutrient composition and chemical, physical and organoleptic properties of cheese, if products made of cheese and other ingredients were made to meet the protein requirements laid down in Annex II to Directive 96/5/EC, they would have too high a fat content and be unpalatable to infants and young children; 
Whereas therefore the protein requirement for those products should be redefined; 
Whereas the diverse culinary habits in the Community have resulted in the marketing of sauces used as accompaniment to a meal which are organoleptically important but not significant in nutrient contribution; whereas therefore these sauces should be exempt from the protein requirements in Annex II; 
Whereas maximum levels for some substances added for nutritional purposes are laid down in the Annexes to Directive 96/5/EC; whereas Article 5 of Directive 96/5/EC provides that maximum levels, in addition to those already stipulated, should be laid down where necessary; 
Whereas Directive 96/5/EC should be amended accordingly; 
Whereas the measures provided in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
