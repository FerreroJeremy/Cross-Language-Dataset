(2) According to the animal health situation in the different third countries specific conditions have to be fulfilled and these are reflected in the veterinary certificate. 
(3) The animal health situation concerning Newcastle disease in poultry has improved in Argentina and Thailand. Therefore the introduction of wild game bird meat should be allowed an the requirements for meat of farmed game birds should be amended for Argentina and Thailand.

(5) Opportunity shall be taken to correct a mistake in the model J certificate for the meat of %quot%wild swine%quot%. 
(6) Decision 2000/585/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
