2.4.2. Impact test 2.4.2.1. Description of the test rig. 2.4.2.1.1. The test rig consists of a pendulum capable of swinging about two horizontal axes at right angles to each other, one of which is perpendicular to the plane containing the %quot%release%quot% trajectory of the pendulum. 
The end of the pendulum comprises a hammer formed by a rigid sphere with a diameter of 165 ± 1 mm and having a 5 mm-thick rubber covering of Shore hardness A 50. 
A device is provided which permits determination of the maximum angle assumed by the arm in the plane of release. 
A support firmly fixed to the structure of the pendulum serves to hold the specimens in compliance with the impact requirements specified in item 2.4.2.2.6. 
Figure 1 below gives the dimensions of the test rig and the special design specifications. 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015078%quot%%gt% %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015079%quot%%gt% 
2.4.2.2. Description of the test. 2.4.2.2.1. The procedure used to clamp the rear-view mirror to the support shall be that recommended by the manufacturer of the device or, where appropriate, by the vehicle manufacturer. 
2.4.2.2.2. Positioning of the rear-view mirror for the test. 2.4.2.2.2.1. Rear-view mirrors shall be so positioned on the pendulum impact rig such that the axes which are horizontal and vertical when the rear-view mirror is installed on a vehicle in accordance with the demander's mounting instructions are in a similar position. 
2.4.2.2.2.2. When a rear-view mirror is adjustable with respect to the base, the test position shall be that in which any pivoting device is least likely to operate, within the limits of adjustment provided by the demander. 
2.4.2.2.2.3. When the rear-view mirror has a device for adjusting its distance from the base, the device must be set in the position in which the distance between the holder and the base is shortest. 
2.4.2.2.2.4. When the reflecting surface is mobile in the holder, it shall be so adjusted that the upper corner which is furthest from the vehicle is in the position of greatest projection relative to the holder. 
2.4.2.2.3. Except in the case of test 2 for interior rear-view mirrors (see item 2.4.2.2.6.1), when the pendulum is in a vertical position the horizontal and longitudinal vertical planes passing through the centre of the hammer shall pass through the centre of the mirror as defined in item 1.10. The longitudinal direction of oscillation of the pendulum shall be parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle. 
2.4.2.2.4. When, under the conditions governing adjustment laid down in items 2.4.2.2.1 and 2.4.2.2.2, parts of the rear-view mirror limit the return of the hammer, the point of impact must be displaced in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation or pivoting in question. 
This displacement must be no greater than is strictly necessary for the execution of the test ; it must be limited in such a way that: - either the sphere delimiting the hammer remains at least tangential to the cylinder as defined in paragraph 2.1.4, 
- or the point of contact with the hammer is located at least 10 mm from the periphery of the reflecting surface. 
2.4.2.2.5. The test consists in allowing the hammer to fall from a height corresponding to a pendulum angle of 60º from the vertical so that the hammer strikes the rear-view mirror at the moment when the pendulum reaches the vertical position. 
2.4.2.2.6. The rear-view mirrors are subjected to impact under the following different conditions: 2.4.2.2.6.1. Interior rear-view mirrors - Test 1 - The point of impact shall be as defined in item 2.4.2.2.3. The impact must be such that the hammer strikes the rear-view mirror on the reflecting surface side. 
- Test 2 - Point of impact on the edge of the housing, so that the impact produced makes an angle of 45º with the plane of the mirror and is situated in the horizontal plane passing through the centre of the mirror. The impact must occur on the reflecting surface side. 
2.4.2.2.6.2. Exterior rear-view mirrors - Test 1 - The point of impact shall be as defined in item 2.4.2.2.3 or 2.4.2.2.4. The impact must be such that the hammer strikes the rear-view mirror on the reflecting surface side. 
- Test 2 - The point of impact shall be as defined in item 2.4.2.2.3 or 2.4.2.2.4. The impact must be such that the hammer strikes the rear-view mirror on the side opposite to the reflecting surface. 
2.4.3. Bending test on the holder fixed to the stem 2.4.3.1. Description of the test 
The holder is placed horizontally in a device in such a way that the adjustment parts of the mounting can be clamped securely. In the direction of the greatest dimension of the holder, the end nearest to the point of fixing on the adjustment part is immobilized by means of a fixed stop 15 mm wide covering the entire width of the holder. 
At the other end, a stop identical to the one described above is placed on the holder so that the specified test load can be applied to it (Figure 2). 
The end of the holder opposite that at which the force is applied may be clamped instead of simply blocked, as shown in Figure 2. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015080%quot%%gt% 
2.4.3.2. The test load is 25 kg. It is applied for one minute. 
2.5. Results of the tests 2.5.1. In the tests described in item 2.4.2, the pendulum must continue to swing after impact in such a way that the projection of the position assumed by the arm on the plane of release makes an angle of at least 20º with the vertical. 
The accuracy of measurement of the angle shall be within ± 1º. 
This requirement is not applicable to rear-view mirrors stuck to the windscreen, in respect of which the requirement stipulated in item 2.5.2 shall apply after the test. 
2.5.2. Should the mounting of the rear-view mirror break during the tests described in item 2.4.2 for rear-view mirrors stuck to the windscreen, the part remaining must not project beyond the base by more than 1 cm and the configuration remaining after the test must satisfy the conditions laid down in item 2.1.3. 
2.5.3. The mirror must not break during the tests described in items 2.4.2 and 2.4.3. However, breakage of the mirror will be allowed if one of the following conditions is fulfilled: 2.5.3.1. the fragments of glass still adhere to the back of the holder or to a surface firmly attached to the holder ; partial separation of the glass from its backing is admissible provided this does not exceed 2 75 mm on either side of the cracks. It is permissible for small splinters to become detached from the surface of the glass at the point of impact; 
2.5.3.2. the mirror is made of safety glass. 
2.6. EEC component type-approval conditions and marking 2.6.1. Application for EEC component type-approval 2.6.1.1. Application for EEC component type-approval for a type of rear-view mirror shall be made by the holder of the trade mark or name, or by his authorized representative. 
2.6.1.2. For each type of rear-view mirror the application shall be accompanied by: 2.6.1.2.1. a technical description, specifying in particular the type(s) of vehicle for which the rear-view mirror is intended;

The %quot%spherometer%quot% described in Figure 1 is used. 
1.2. Measuring points 1.2.1. The principal radii of curvature shall be measured at three points situated as close as possible to positions at one third, half and two thirds of the distance along the arc of the reflecting surface passing through the centre of the mirror and parallel to segment b, or of the arc passing through the centre of the mirror which is perpendicular to it if this arc is the longer. 
1.2.2. Where, owing to the size of the mirror, it is impossible to obtain measurements in the directions defined in item 1.8 of Annex I, the technical services responsible for the tests may take measurements at the said point in two perpendicular directions as close as possible to those prescribed above. 
2. CALCULATION OF THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE (r) 
%quot%r%quot% expressed in mm is calculated from the formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015084%quot%%gt% 
where: 
rp1 = the radius of curvature at the first measuring point, 
rp2 = the radius of curvature at the second measuring point, 
rp3 = the radius of curvature at the third measuring point.

Appendix 2 TEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING REFLECTIVITY 
1. DEFINITIONS %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015086%quot%%gt% 
2. APPARATUS 
2.1. General 
The apparatus shall consist of a light source, a holder ror the test sample, a receiver unit with a photodetector and an indicating meter (see figure 1), and means of eliminating the effects of extraneous light. 
The receiver may incorporate a light-integrating sphere to facilitate measuring the reflectance of non-flat (convex) mirrors (see figure 2). 
2.2. Spectral characteristics of light source and receiver 
The light source shall consist of a CIE standard source A and associated optics to provide a near-collimated light beam. A voltage stabilizer is recommended in order to maintain a fixed lamp voltage during instrument operation. 
The receiver shall have a photodetector with a spectral response proportional to the photopic luminosity function of the CIE (1931) standard colorimetric observer (see table). Any other combination of illuminant-filter-receptor giving the overall equivalent of CIE standard illuminant A and photopic vision may be used. When an integrating sphere is used in the receiver, the interior surface of the sphere shall be coated with a matt (diffusive) spectrally non-selective white coating. 
2.3. Geometrical conditions %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015312%quot%%gt% 
When an integrating sphere is used in the receiver section, the sphere shall have a minimum diameter of 127 mm (5 in). The sample and incident beam apertures in the sphere wall shall be of such a size as to admit the entire incident and reflected light beams. The photodetector shall be so located as not to receive direct light from either the incident or the reflected beam. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0015315%quot%%gt% 
2.4. Electrical characteristics of the photodetector-indicator unit 
The photodetector output as read on the indicating meter shall be a linear function of the light intensity on the photosensitive area. Means (electrical and/or optical) shall be provided to facilitate zeroing and calibration adjustments. Such means shall not affect the linearity or the spectral characteristics of the instrument. The accuracy of the receptor-indicator unit shall be within ± 2 % of full scale, or ± 10 % of the magnitude of the reading, whichever is the smaller. 
2.5. Sample holder 
The mechanism shall be capable of locating the test sample so that the axes of the source arm and receptor intersect at the reflecting surface. The reflecting surface may lie within or at either face of the mirror sample, depending on whether it is a first-surface, second-surface or prismatic %quot%flip%quot%-type mirror. 
3. PROCEDURE 3.1. Direct calibration method 
In the direct calibration method, air is used as the reference standard. This method is applicable for those instruments which are so constructed as to permit calibration at the 100 % point by swinging the receiver to a position directly on the axis of the light source (see figure 1). 
It may be desired in some cases (such as when measuring low-reflectivity surfaces) to use an intermediate calibration point (between 0 and 100 % on the scale) with this method. In these cases, a neutral density filter of known transmittance shall be inserted in the optical path, and the calibration control shall then be adjusted until the meter reads the percentage transmission of the neutral density filter. This filter shall be removed before reflectivity measurements are performed. 
3.2. Indirect calibration method 
The indirect calibration method is applicable in the case of instruments with fixed source and receiver geometry. A properly calibrated and maintained reflectance standard is required. This reference standard should preferably be a flat mirror with a reflectance value as near as possible to that of the test samples. 
3.3. Flat mirror measurement 
The reflectance of flat mirror samples can be measured on instruments employing either the direct or the indirect calibration method. The reflectance value is read directly from the indicating meter.
