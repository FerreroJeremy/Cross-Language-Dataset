THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 (2), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Whereas detailed rules should be laid down for the application of the new system of minimum import prices for certain soft fruits originating in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and intended for processing, introduced in the Annexes to the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1595/97; whereas in the interests of clarity and presentation the minimum prices set in the Annexes to the aforementioned Annexes should be included in a single table attached to this Regulation; 
Whereas the word 'lot` used in paragraph 2 of the Annexes to the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 needs to be defined; 
Whereas, for the sound application of the system, the characteristics enabling each frozen product to be classified in one of the classes listed in the Annexes to the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 should be specified; 
Whereas regular communication by the Member States of information concerning imports is needed; whereas provisions concerning these communications will replace those laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1226/92 of 13 May 1992 on communication by the Member States to the Commission of information on imports of certain products processed from fruit and vegetables (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2480/96 (4); whereas, however, the provisions of that Regulation concerning products originating in third countries other than those referred to in this Regulation and adopted pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1926/96 (5) should be maintained; 
Whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 repeals Council Regulation (EEC) No 1988/93 of 19 July 1993 on the system of minimum import prices for certain soft fruits originating in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria (6); whereas, consequently, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2140/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down detailed rules for the application of the minimum import price system for certain soft fruits originating in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria and fixing the minimum import prices applicable until 30 April 1994 (7), Commission Regulation (EC) No 767/97 of 28 April 1997 fixing the minimum import prices for certain soft fruits originating in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria for the 1997/98 marketing year (8) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 517/97 of 21 March 1997 on the application of a minimum price for certain soft fruits originating in Poland (9) should be repealed; 
Whereas, during the period 1 July 1997 to the date of entry into force of this Regulation, importers should be given the choice as regards the import charge, comprising the ad valorem duty and where applicable the countervailing charge, between the old and the new systems; whereas this Regulation should apply therefore from 1 July 1997 at the request of the operator only;

or 
(c) the price has not been paid to the seller within a period of three months from the day following the date of acceptance of the declaration of release for free circulation by the customs authorities,

2. Where the value shown in the customs declaration is below the minimum price shown in the Annex, a countervailing charge shall be levied equal to the difference between that value and the minimum price. 
Article 4 
1. A lot of frozen strawberries or raspberries shall be classified as 'whole fruit` for the purposes of this Regulation if it consists of fruit frozen individually which meets the following maximum requirements:

In the case of strawberries, a lot of 'whole fruit` may contain only fruit classified, prior to removal of stalks from the fresh fruit, in the 'Extra` or 'I` classes.
