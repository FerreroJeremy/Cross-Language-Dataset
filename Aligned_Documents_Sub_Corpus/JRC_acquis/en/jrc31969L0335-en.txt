Council Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (69/335/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 99 and 100 thereof; 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1); 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2); 
Whereas the objective of the Treaty is to create an economic union whose characteristics are similar to those of a domestic market and whereas one of the essential conditions for achieving this is the promotion of the free movement of capital; 
Whereas the indirect taxes on the raising of capital, in force in the Member States at the present time, namely the duty chargeable on contribution of capital to companies and firms and the stamp duty on securities, give rise to discrimination, double taxation and disparities which interfere with the free movement of capital and which, consequently, must be eliminated by harmonisation; 
Whereas the harmonisation of such taxes on the raising of capital must be arranged in such a way as to minimise the budgetary repercussions for Member States; 
Whereas the charging of stamp duty by a Member State on securities from other Member States introduced into or issued within its territory is contrary to the concept of a common market whose characteristics are those of a domestic market ; whereas, in addition, it has become evident that the retention of stamp duty on the issue of securities in respect of internal loans and on the introduction or issue on the market of a Member State of foreign securities is both undesirable from the economic point of view and inconsistent with current developments in the tax laws of the Member States in this field; 
Whereas, in these circumstances, it is advisable to abolish the stamp duty on securities, regardless of the origin of such securities, and regardless of whether they represent a company's own capital or its loan capital; 
Whereas it is inherent in the concept of a common market whose characteristics are those of a domestic market that duty on the raising of capital within the common market by a company or firm should be charged only once and that the level of this duty should be the same in all Member States so as not to interfere with the movement of capital; 
Whereas, therefore, this duty should be harmonised, with regard both to its structures and to its rates; 
Whereas the retention of other indirect taxes with the same characteristics as the capital duty or the stamp duty on securities might frustrate the purpose of the measures provided for in this Directive and those taxes should therefore be abolished; 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Member States shall charge on contributions of capital to capital companies a duty harmonised in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 9 and hereinafter called %quot%capital duty%quot%.

- the companies taking part in the transaction have their effective centre of management or their registered office within the territory of a Member State; 
(c) the rate of capital duty may be reduced to 0.5 % until 1 January 1973 and to 1 % from that date in the case of formation of, or increase in, the capital of holding or investment companies whose sole object is the holding of shares in other undertakings and the management and turning to profitable account of such shares, subject to the condition that such companies do not engage in industry or commerce on their own account and do not operate a commercial establishment open to the public.
