Commission Regulation (EC) No 1096/2001 
of 5 June 2001 
amending Regulations (EC) No 1143/98, (EC) No 1081/1999, (EC) No 1128/1999 and (EC) No 1247/1999 in the beef and veal sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV(6) negotiations(2), and in particular Article 1(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The following Regulations lay down the rules for administering tariff quotas for live, bovine animals: 
- Commission Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 of 2 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for a tariff quota for cows and heifers of specified mountain breeds originating in various third countries, other than for slaughter, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1012/98(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1081/1999(4) 
- Commission Regulation (EC) No 1081/1999 of 26 May 1999 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for imports of bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain alpine and mountain breeds, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 and amending Regulation (EC) No 1143/98, 
- Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/1999 of 28 May 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for a tariff quota for calves weighing not more than 80 kilograms originating in certain third countries(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2857/2000(6), 
- Commission Regulation (EC) No 1247/1999 of 16 June 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of a tariff quota for live bovine animals weighing from 80 to 300 kilograms and originating in certain third countries(7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2857/2000. 
(2) For the purpose of allocating the quotas, the method provided for in the third indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 should be applied, avoiding discrimination between the traders concerned. Access to the quotas concerned should therefore be extended to those traders known as %quot%new arrivals%quot%. 
(3) There is a sharp increase in the number of %quot%new arrivals%quot% submitting applications under certain tariff quotas. The access criterion should therefore be made more rigorous where trade in live animals is concerned. 
(4) The BSE and foot-and-mouth crises have disturbed trade in livestock. The reference periods fixed for traditional traders and new arrivals should therefore end before these crises began. 
(5) In order to prevent speculation: 
- a security relating to import rights should be fixed, 
- the possibility of transferring import licences should be excluded. 
(6) In order to oblige traders to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, this obligation should be a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(9). 
(7) The Regulations listed in the first recital therefore need to be amended accordingly. 
(8) In view of the dates for submission of applications for import rights, this Regulation must take effect immediately. 
(9) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
