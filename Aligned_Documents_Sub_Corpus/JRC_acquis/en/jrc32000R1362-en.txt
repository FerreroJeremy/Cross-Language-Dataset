Council Regulation (EC) No 1362/2000 of 29 June 2000 implementing for the Community the tariff provisions of Decision No 2/2000 of the Joint Council under the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters between the European Community and the United Mexican States 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1362/2000 
of 29 June 2000 
implementing for the Community the tariff provisions of Decision No 2/2000 of the Joint Council under the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters between the European Community and the United Mexican States 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Joint Council under the Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters between the European Community and the United Mexican States has by its Decision No 2/2000, adopted arrangements for implementing aspects of that Agreement related to trade in goods with effect from 1 July 2000. 
(2) The tariff preferences provided in Decision No 2/2000 are applicable to products originating in Mexico in accordance with Annex III to the said Decision. 
(3) It is necessary to lay down special provisions for applying those tariff preferences within the Community. 
(4) The base rates for calculating tariff reductions are those set out in Decision 2/2000. 
(5) The same methods of calculation should, as a general rule, apply to ad valorem and specific rates of duty as well as to the treatment of minimum and maximum duties provided in the Common Customs Tariff. 
(6) Decision No 2/2000 stipulates that certain products originating in Mexico may be imported into the Community within the limits of tariff quotas, at a reduced or a zero rate of customs duty. The said Decision specifies the products eligible for those tariff measures, their volumes and duties. The tariff quotas should be managed, as a rule, on a first-come first-served basis in accordance with Articles 308a to 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(1). The tarif quota for some products is subject to satisfaction of specific rules of origin for a given period of time. This tariff quota should also be managed on the first-come first-served basis mentioned above. 
(7) The Combined Nomenclature codes mentioned in this Regulation are those of 2000, as provided in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(2). Amendments to the Combined Nomenclature and TARIC codes should not result in changes of substance in agreements or other acts concluded between the Community and Mexico. In the interests of simplicity, provision should therefore be made for the Commission, assisted by the Customs Code Committee, to take the measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation, in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers of the Commission(3). 
(8) In the interest of combating fraud, provisions should be made to submit preferential imports into the Community to surveillance,
