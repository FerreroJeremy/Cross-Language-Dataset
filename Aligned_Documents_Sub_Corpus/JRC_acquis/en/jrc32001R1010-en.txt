THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2699/2000(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 provides for a system of aid for producer organisations delivering peaches or pears for processing into products listed in Annex I to that Regulation. 
(2) Mixtures of fruit in syrup and in natural fruit juice were added to the above Annex by Regulation (EC) No 2699/2000.
