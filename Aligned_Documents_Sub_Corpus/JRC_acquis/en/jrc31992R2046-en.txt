COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2046/92 of 30 June 1992 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas, in view of trends, in the olive-oil market and in its relations with other vegetable-oil markets, the representative market price and the threshold price should be fixed at the same time as the other official olive-oil prices; whereas, for this reason, the criteria for fixing the representative market price should also be adapted; 
Whereas in order to ensure that the greatest number of producers are guaranteed intervention prices, access to Community intervention should be permitted to producer groups and associations thereof recognized under Regulation (EEC) No 136/66/EEC (4); 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 136/66/EEC should therefore be amended, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

3. in Article 5 (1) the second subparagraph is replaced by the following: 
'Each year the Council shall fix the unit amount of production aid in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty. A separate unit amount may be fixed for producers whose average production is less than 500 kg of olive oil per marketing year.'; 
4. Article 7 is replaced by the following: 
'Article 7 
The representative market price shall be fixed at a level permitting the normal disposal of olive-oil production, having regard, in particular, to the outlook for trends on the vegetable oils and fats market.';

The intervention agencies shall buy in at the intervention price. The buying-in price shall be adjusted by means of a scale of price increases and reductions where the description or quality of the oil offered to the intervention agency does not correspond to that for which the intervention price was fixed.'
