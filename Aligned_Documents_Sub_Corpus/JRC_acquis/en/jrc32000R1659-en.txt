Commission Regulation (EC) No 1659/2000 
of 26 July 2000 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Articles 29(2) and 33(12) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1439/2000(3), derogates from Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1127/1999(5), by setting at EUR 60 the amount below which no licence is required for products for which no refund has been claimed. For the sake of simplification it is necessary to convert that amount into head for live bovines and into tonnes for other products. 
(2) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 lays down a period of validity of 75 days for export licences with advance fixing of the refund for pure-bred breeding animals falling within CN code 0102 10 and a period of four months plus the current month for licences issued under the procedure referred to in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88. Experience has shown that those periods are too brief and that they should be extended to five months plus the current month. At the same time, there should accordingly be a derogation increasing from 21 to 90 days the time limit referred to in Article 44(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 within which the exporter must inform the agency issuing the licence of the result of a tendering procedure opened in a third country. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
