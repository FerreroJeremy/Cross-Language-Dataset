Commission Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000 
of 21 December 2000 
laying down the detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of carry-over aid for certain fishery products 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 23(5) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, which repealed Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92(2) with effect from 1 January 2001, provides for the granting of carry-over aid under certain conditions for the stabilisation or processing and storage of the products set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 which have been withdrawn from the market. The role of the carry-over aid mechanism in the common market organisation as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 and in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3901/92 of 23 December 1992 introducing detailed rules for granting carry-over aid on certain fishery products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1337/95(4) has been re-evaluated. This resulted in an increase in the quantities eligible for this aid. It is therefore appropriate to simplify the procedures required under the carry-over aid mechanism and to replace Regulation (EEC) No 3901/92 by the present Regulation. 
(2) Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 of 26 November 1996 laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2578/2000(6), provides that certain products that are classified as category B are ineligible for the financial assistance granted in respect of the intervention mechanisms of the common market organisation. Given that only Extra, %quot%E%quot% and %quot%A%quot% quality products are eligible for carry-over aid set out in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the calculation of the quantities eligible for this aid should be based on these categories of products only. 
(3) In order to give maximum encouragement to action to stabilise the market, producer organisations not observing the Community withdrawal price throughout the fishing year should be excluded from receiving financial compensation for carry-over aid. 
(4) Systematic compliance with the common marketing standards referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 is a determining factor in price formation and contributes to stabilisation of the market. The granting of compensation for carry-over aid on eligible quantities should therefore be made conditional on compliance with the standards for all quantities of the product in question put up for sale by the producer organisation or its members throughout the fishing year. 
(5) The mechanisms for carry-over aid and financial compensation for withdrawals are parallel and complementary as regards their operation and share the same objective of stabilising the market in the products in question. The conditions relating to the quantities which may qualify for carry-over aid as well as to the use of a tolerance margin and to the certifying document to be used when the products are withdrawn in another Member State should be the same as those laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 of 15 November 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards granting financial compensation for withdrawal of certain fishery products(7). 
(6) To ensure product quality and to facilitate the disposal of products on the market, the minimum requirements to be satisfied by operations qualifying for aid should be laid down, together with the requirements relating to storage and return to the market of the product concerned. 
(7) The producer organisations should contribute to the costs related to the implementation of the carry-over aid mechanisms and therefore, the amount of aid should be fixed on the basis of the real technical costs and financial costs of stabilisation and storage operations. The technical costs should be defined on the basis of the immediate costs incurred under the mechanism. In order to avoid burdensome information requirements from the industry and complicated annual calculations the financial costs should be a flat-rate sum adjusted on the basis of the interest rate determined in accordance with Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1259/96(9). 
(8) The beneficiaries of aid should be obliged to keep stock records to increase the efficiency of checks and must communicate this information to the Member State. It is sufficient for the purposes of good management of the mechanism to require stock records during the minimum storage periods. 
(9) The procedure for submitting applications for the payment of carry-over aid should be laid down as well as the procedure for the granting of advance payments and the amount of the relevant security. 
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The quantities of products eligible for carry-over aid under Article 23(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be calculated on the basis of quantities that are classified under the marketing standards set out in Article 2 of that Regulation as being of Extra, %quot%E%quot% and %quot%A%quot% quality only.

1. Carry-over aid shall only be paid to producer organisations as referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. 
2. Payment of the carry-over aid for eligible quantities of products shall be subject to the condition that, for the product or group of products concerned, all the quantities put up for sale by the producers organisation or its members during the fishing year have been classified previously in accordance with the marketing standards referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. 
3. The requirements referred to in Article 23(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be fulfilled when the products are classified under the marketing standards set out in Article 2 of that Regulation.

This processing may be carried out by the producers organisation concerned or by an enterprise to which the producers organisation sends the products. 
Before processing, products must be stored in such a way as to guarantee the upholding of their initial freshness category. 
2. Without prejudice to more restrictive national requirements or commercial standards practised in the Member States, the various processing methods must meet the following minimum conditions: 
(a) freezing must be carried out in appropriate installations which guarantee inter alia that a temperature of minus 18 째C is rapidly reached at the centre of the product;

(c) drying must be carried out in such a way that the water content of the processed product does not exceed 50 %; 
(d) marinating must take the form of treating the product with vinegar or food acid, salt and aromatic spices without heating the product so that the pH of the product is less than 4,8; 
(e) pasteurisation must be carried out in such a way that the core temperature of the product is maintained at at least 75 째C for at least 15 minutes. 
3. The storage of live edible crabs in fixed tanks or cages supplied with sea or salt water and approved for the purpose by Member States shall qualify as preservation for payment of the carry-over aid. 
Article 4 
1. Products shall only qualify for the carry-over aid if, having been irreversibly processed, they meet the minimum conditions for storage and return to the market set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. 
2. In the case of frozen products the period of storage must not be less than five days as from the date on which processing is completed and the storage temperature must not be higher than minus 18 째C. 
In the case of salted, marinated, boiled or pasteurised products, the period of storage must not be less than five days as from the date on which processing is completed. 
In the case of dried products, the period of storage must not be less than five days from the date on which processing is completed, with a storage temperature not exceeding 4 째C and under appropriate conditions of humidity. 
In the case of all products stored in tanks or cages, the period of storage must not be less than five days. 
3. All products shall be placed back on the market in homogeneous lots by species, and in accordance with the provisions in force in each Member State for the marketing of products for human consumption. 
Products stored live in tanks or cages shall be placed back on the market for sale in such a way as not to interfere with normal marketing of the products concerned. 
4. Once returned for sale, products may not be stored a further time in order to qualify for the aid. 
Article 5 
1. The level of the carry-over aid shall be fixed before the beginning of each fishing year in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 38(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. 
The carry-over aid shall be fixed per unit weight, to be applied to the net weight of the products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. 
2. The amount of the aid shall be calculated on the basis of the real technical costs and financial costs of operations indispensable for stabilising and storing the products in question as recorded in the Community during the previous fishing year.
