COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3207/88 
of 17 October 1988 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 on the common organization of the market in eggs 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Whereas the Community is a Contracting Party to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, hereinafter referred to as the 'harmonized system', which replaces the Convention of 15 December 1950 on Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs tariffs; 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (3) established, from 1 January 1988, a combined goods nomenclature which meets the requirements both of the Common Customs Tariff and of the external trade statistics of the Community; 
Whereas, as a result, it is necessary to express the descriptions of goods and tariff heading numbers which appear in Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 (4), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 4000/87 (5), according to the terms of the combined nomenclature based on the harmonized system; 
Whereas cooked eggs in shell and moulded egg products such as cylindrical 'long eggs' were classified in a subheading of heading No 21.07 (food preparations not elsewhere specified or included) of the Common Customs Tariff which was in force until 31 December 1987; whereas the said egg products were therefore not considered to be products covered by Annex II to the Treaty; whereas, with the introduction of the combined nomenclature, these products are now classified under CN code 0407 (birds' eggs, in shell, fresh, preserved or cooked) or 0408 (birds' eggs, not in shell and egg yolks, fresh, dried, cooked by steaming or by boiling in water, moulded, frozen or otherwise preserved, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter); whereas cooked eggs in shell and moulded egg products may be used in the same way as, or as a replacement for, preserved eggs in shell or not in shell; whereas preserved eggs are included in the said Annex II and are therefore specified in Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75; whereas it is logical and desirable that cooked eggs in shell and moulded egg products should also be mentioned in the said Regulation; 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 4000/87 should be repealed; 
Whereas numerous Regulations in the egg sector must be adapted to take account of the use of the new nomenclature; whereas, pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, only changes of a purely technical nature may be made; whereas, accordingly, a provision should be introduced whereby all other adjustments should be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75, provided that such adjustments are required solely as a result of the introduction of the harmonized system,
