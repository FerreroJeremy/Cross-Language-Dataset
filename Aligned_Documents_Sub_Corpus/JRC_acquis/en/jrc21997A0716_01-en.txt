- making tourism more competitive through support for increased professionalism ensuring the balanced and sustainable development of tourism. 
Article 52 Customs cooperation 
Customs cooperation is intended to ensure that the provisions on trade are observed and to guarantee fair trading. 
It could give rise to the following types of cooperation:

- introduction of the single administrative document and a system to link up the Community's and the Palestinian Authority's transit arrangements, and 
- technical assistance provided by experts from the Community. 
Without prejudice to other forms of cooperation provided for in this Agreement, the administrative authorities of the Parties will provide each other with mutual assistance on customs matters. 
Article 53 Cooperation on statistics 
The main objective of cooperation in this domain should aim to ensure the comparability and usefulness of statistics on foreign trade, finance and balance of payments, population, migration, transport and communications, and generally all the fields which are covered by this Agreement and lend themselves to the establishment of statistics. 
Article 54 Cooperation on economic policy 
Cooperation is aimed at: 
- the exchange of information on the macro-economic situation and prospects and development strategies, 
- joint analysis of economic issues of mutual interest, and 
- the encouragement of cooperation between economists and policy makers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and in the Community. 
Article 55 Regional cooperation 
As part of the implementation of economic cooperation in the various spheres, the Parties will encourage operations designed to develop cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and other Mediterranean partners, through technical support. 
This cooperation will be an important element of the Community's support for the development of the region as a whole. 
Priority will be given to operations aimed at: 
- promoting intra-regional trade, 
- developing regional cooperation on the environment, 
- encouraging the development of the communications infrastructure required for the economic development of the region, 
- strengthening the development of youth cooperation with neighbouring countries.

TITLE IV COOPERATION ON AUDIO-VISUAL AND CULTURAL MATTERS, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION 
Article 56

The Parties shall seek ways of associating the Palestinian Authority with Community initiatives in this sector, thus enabling cooperation in areas such as co-production, training, development and distribution. 
Article 57 
The Parties shall promote cultural cooperation. The area of cooperation may include Community activities concerning, in particular, translation, exchange of works of art and artists, conservation and restoration of historic and cultural monuments and sites, training of persons working in the cultural field, the organization of European-oriented cultural events, raising mutual awareness and contributing to the dissemination of information on outstanding cultural events. 
Article 58 
The Parties will undertake to determine how to improve significantly the education and vocational training situation. To this end, the access of women to education, including technical courses, higher education and vocational training, will receive special attention. 
In order to develop the level of expertise of senior staff in the public and private sectors, the Parties will step up their cooperation on education and vocational training and cooperation between universities and firms. 
Preparing young people to become active citizens in democratic civil society should be actively promoted. Youth cooperation, including training of youth workers and youth leaders, youth exchanges and voluntary service activities, could therefore be supported and developed. 
Special attention will be paid to operations and programmes which will enable permanent links (MED-CAMPUS, for instance) to be established between specialized bodies in the Community and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, such as will encourage the pooling and exchange of experience and technical resources.

Financial cooperation shall focus on: 
- responding to the economic repercussions for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of the gradual introduction of a free trade area, notably by upgrading and restructuring industry, 
- trade institutions which promote trading links with foreign markets, 
- accompanying measures for policies implemented in the social sector,

- promoting reforms designed to modernize the economy,

Article 2 General requirements 
1. For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the Community: 
(a) products wholly obtained in the Community within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol; 
(b) products obtained in the Community incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Community within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol.

(a) products wholly obtained in the West Bank and Gaza Strip within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol; 
(b) products obtained in the West Bank and Gaza Strip incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol. 
Article 3 Bilateral cumulation of origin 
1. Materials originating in the Community shall be considered as materials originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6 (1) of this Protocol. 
2. Materials originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip shall be considered as materials originating in the Community when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6 (1) of this Protocol. 
Article 4 Wholly obtained products 
1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the Community or the West Bank and Gaza Strip: 
(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed; 
(b) vegetable products harvested there; 
(c) live animals born and raised there;

(k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (j). 
2. The terms 'their vessels` and 'their factory ships` in paragraph 1 (f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:

(b) which sail under the flag of an EC Member State or of the West Bank and Gaza Strip;

(d) of which the master and officers are nationals of EC Member States or of the West Bank and Gaza Strip; and 
(e) of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of EC Member States or of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Article 5 Sufficiently worked or processed products 
1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled. 
The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture. 
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that: 
(a) their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product; 
(b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph. 
This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System. 
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided in Article 6. 
Article 6 Insufficient working or processing operations 
1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:

(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f); 
(h) slaughter of animals.

Article 7 Unit of qualification 
1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System. 
Accordingly, it follows that: 
(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonized System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification; 
(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol. 
2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin. 
Article 8 Accessories, spare parts and tools 
Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question. 
Article 9 Sets 
Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set. 
Article 10 Neutral elements 
In order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:

(b) plant and equipment; 
(c) machines and tools; 
(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.

(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported. 
Article 12 Direct transport 
1. The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies only to products, satisfying the requirements of this Protocol, which are transported directly between the Community and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.

(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community or the West Bank and Gaza Strip; 
(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and

2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the Community or the West Bank and Gaza Strip to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there. 
3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid. 
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 7 (2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 when such items are non-originating. 
5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which the Agreement applies. Furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 
6. The provisions of this Article shall apply from 1 January 2000 and may be reviewed by common accord.

Article 22 Validity of proof of origin 
1. A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country. 
2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. 
3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date. 
Article 23 Submission of proof of origin 
Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement. 
Article 24 Importation by instalments 
Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2 (a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or heading Nos 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment. 
Article 25 Exemptions from proof of origin 
1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration C2/CP3 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document. 
2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view. 
3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed ECU 500 in the case of small packages or ECU 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage. 
Article 26 Supporting documents

Article 28 Discrepancies and formal errors 
1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted. 
2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document. 
Article 29 Amounts expressed in ecu 
1. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting country equivalent to the amounts expressed in ecu shall be fixed by the exporting country and communicated to the importing countries through the European Commission. 
2. When the amounts exceed the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing country, the latter shall accept them if the products are invoiced in the currency of the exporting country. When the products are invoiced in the currency of another EC Member State, the importing country shall recognize the amount notified by the country concerned. 
3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the amounts expressed in ecu as at the first working day in October 1996. 
4. The amounts expressed in ecu and their equivalents in the currencies of the EC Member States and the West Bank and Gaza Strip shall be reviewed by the Joint Committee at the request of the Community or the Palestinian Authority. When carrying out this review, the Joint Committee shall ensure that there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in ecu. 
TITLE VI ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION 
Article 30 Mutual assistance 
1. The customs authorities of the EC Member States and of the West Bank and Gaza Strip shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations. 
2.

2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification. 
3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. 
4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. 
5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. 
6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences. 
Article 32 Dispute settlement

Article 34 Free zones 
1. The Community and the Palestinian Authority shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration. 
2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or the West Bank and Gaza Strip are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol. 
TITLE VII CEUTA AND MELILLA 
Article 35 Application of the Protocol 
1. The term 'Community` used in Article 2 does not cover Ceuta and Melilla. 
2. Products originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Community under Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities. The Palestinian Authority shall grant to imports of products covered by the Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Community.

ANNEX I 
INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II 
Note 1: 
The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of the Protocol. 
Note 2: 
2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex`, this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 
2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1. 
2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4. 
2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied. 
Note 3: 
3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Example: 
An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from 'other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging` of heading No ex 7224. 
If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used. 
3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not. 
3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that 'materials of any heading` may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression 'manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .` means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used. 
3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used. 
Example: 
The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both. 
3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles). 
Example: 
The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals. 
However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture. 
Example: 
In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage. 
3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to. 
Note 4: 
4.1. The term 'natural fibres` is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun. 
4.2. The term 'natural fibres` includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305. 
4.3. The terms 'textile pulp`, 'chemical materials` and 'paper-making materials` are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 
4.4. The term 'man-made staple fibres` is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507. 
Note 5: 
5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below). 
5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials. 
The following are the basic textile materials: 
- silk, 
- wool, 
- coarse animal hair, 
- fine animal hair, 
- horsehair, 
- cotton, 
- paper-making materials and paper, 
- flax, 
- true hemp, 
- jute and other textile bast fibres, 
- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave, 
- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres, 
- synthetic man-made filaments, 
- artificial man-made filaments, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide, 
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride, 
- other synthetic man-made staple fibres, 
- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose, 
- other artificial man-made staple fibres, 
- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped, 
- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped, 
- products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, 
- other products of heading No 5605. 
Example: 
A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn. 
Example: 
A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric. 
Example: 
Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures. 
Example: 
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product. 
Example: 
A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the textile materials of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met. 
5.3. In the case of products incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped` this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn. 
5.4. In the case of products incorporating 'strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film`, this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip. 
Note 6: 
6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per cent of the ex-works price of the product. 
6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles. 
Example: 
If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles. 
6.3. Where a percentage rules applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated. 
Note 7: 
7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the 'specific processes` are the following: 
(a) vacuum distillation; 
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1); 
(c) cracking; 
(d) reforming; 
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents; 
(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; 
(g) polymerization; 
(h) alkylation; 
(i) isomerization. 
7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the 'specific processes` are the following: 
(a) vacuum distillation; 
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2); 
(c) cracking; 
(d) reforming; 
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents; 
(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; 
(g) polymerization; 
(h) alkylation; 
(ij) isomerization; 
(k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method); 
(l) in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering; 
(m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process; 
(n) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distil, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C by the ASTM D 86 method; 
(o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge. 
7.3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.

JOINT DECLARATIONS Joint Declaration on intellectual, industrial and commercial property (Article 33 of the Agreement) 
For the purpose of the Agreement, intellectual, industrial and commercial property includes in particular copyright, including the copyright in computer programmes, and neighbouring rights, patents, industrial designs, geographical indications, including appellations of origin, trademarks and service marks, topographies of integrated circuits, as well as protection against unfair competition as referred to in Article 10a of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Stockholm Act, 1967) and protection of undisclosed information on 'know-how`. 
Joint Declaration on Article 55 of the Agreement 
The Parties reaffirm their commitment to the Middle East Peace Process and their belief that peace should be consolidated through regional cooperation. The Community is prepared to support joint development projects submitted by the Palestinian Authority and other regional parties, subject to relevant Community technical and budgetary procedures. 
The Parties reaffirm that the Agreement forms part of the process launched at the Barcelona Conference of 27 November 1995 and that the bilateral cooperation between the European Community and the Palestinian Authority is complementary to the regional cooperation taking place in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. 
Joint Declaration on Article 58 of the Agreement 
The Parties agree that access to employment will not be included in the framework of youth exchange programmes. 
Joint Declaration on decentralized cooperation 
The Parties reaffirm the importance they attach to decentralized cooperation programmes as a means of encouraging exchanges of experience and transfer of knowledge in the Mediterranean region and between the European Community and its Mediterranean partners. 
Joint Declaration on Article 67 of the Agreement 
When the arbitration procedure is applied, the Parties will endeavour to ensure that the Joint Committee appoints a third arbitrator within two months of the appointment of the second arbitrator. 
Joint Declaration on Article 70 of the Agreement 
1. The Parties agree, for the purposes of the interpretation and the application of the Agreement, that the cases of special urgency referred to in Article 70 of the Agreement mean cases of substantial violation of the Agreement by one of the two Parties. A substantial violation of the Agreement consists of: 
- the rejection of the Agreement when such rejection is not authorized by the general rules of international law, 
- the violation of the essential elements of the Agreement set out in Article 2 thereof. 
2. The Parties agree that the appropriate measures referred to in Article 70 are measures taken in accordance with international law. If one Party takes a measure in a case of special urgency in application of Article 70 the other Party may invoke the dispute settlement procedure. 
Joint Declaration on data protection 
The Parties agree that the protection of data will be guaranteed in all areas where the exchange of personal data is envisaged. 
Joint Declaration on a programme of support for Palestinian industry 
The Parties agree that a programme of support will be put at the disposal of Palestinian industry, designed to nurture and develop the capacity of the Palestinian industrial sector. 
The Community extends access to start-up funding and to capital to Palestinian businesses in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This includes the European Community Investment Partners programme (ECIP), which provides assistance for business start-up costs, such as feasibility studies and technical assistance, and in some cases, access to funding for joint ventures. Loan funding, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, through a revolving fund administered by the Palestinian Development Fund, is also available on the basis of grants provided by the Community. The European Investment Bank extends loan funding and risk capital to Palestinian business through local banks. 
The Community has established the Centre for Private Development in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in order to provide support, training and advice to Palestinian industry, in business start-up and planning, business management, strategy and marketing. 
The Community recognizes that Palestinian industry must seek markets abroad. The present Agreement therefore permits duty-free access of Palestinian industrial products to European Community markets. The Palestinian Enterprise Centre, and, within it, the Euro-Info Centre, are therefore available to promote and facilitate contacts and joint ventures between European and Palestinian industry, through partnership events (the Euro-Partenariat, Med-Partenariat and Med-Enterprise schemes) and a variety of other means (such as the BC Net and BRE networks), which from time to time become available. 
The Community also recognizes that Palestinian industry has suffered from a lack of basic economic infrastructure. Noting that, in the context of the assistance provided by the Community for the development of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, part of this assistance may be provided in support of Palestinian industry, the Community will consider requests from the Palestinian Authority that a proportion of these funds, as grants or loans, may be devoted to the rehabilitation of vital economic infrastructures. 
In the framework of the economic cooperation provided for under the current Agreement, the two Parties will have regular exchanges of views in order to establish how the range of support mechanisms described in this Declaration, as well as any others which may become available, may most effectively be combined to provide the most appropriate support to Palestinian industry. 
Joint Declaration concerning the Principality of Andorra 
1. Products originating in the Principality of Andorra falling within Chapters 25 to 97 of the Harmonized System shall be accepted by the Palestinian Authority as originating in the Community within the meaning of this Agreement. 
2. Protocol 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purpose of defining the originating status of the abovementioned products. 
Joint Declaration concerning the Republic of San Marino 
1. Products originating in the Republic of San Marino shall be accepted by the Palestinian Authority as originating in the Community within the meaning of this Agreement. 
2. Protocol 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purpose of defining the originating status of the abovementioned products.
