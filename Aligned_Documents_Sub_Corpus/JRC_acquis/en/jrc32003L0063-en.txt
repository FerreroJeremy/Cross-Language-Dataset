Commission directive 2003/63/EC 
of 25 June 2003 
amending Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating medicinal products for human use(1), as last amended by Directive 2002/98/EC(2), and in particular Article 120 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Every medicinal product for human use that is to be placed on the European Community market must be granted a marketing authorisation delivered by a competent authority. With the view to obtaining a marketing authorisation, an application dossier containing particulars and documents relating to the results of tests and trials carried out on this medicinal product must be submitted. 
(2) The detailed scientific and technical requirements of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC need to be adapted to take account of scientific and technical progress and in particular of a large set of new requirements resulting from recent legislation. The presentation and content of the marketing authorisation application dossier have to be improved in order to facilitate the assessment and the better use of certain parts of the dossier which are common to several medicinal products. 
(3) Within the framework of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) a consensus was reached in 2000 to provide a harmonised format and terminology for a Common Technical Document through which a homogeneous organisation and presentation of a marketing authorisation application dossier for human medicinal products could be achieved. Standardised marketing authorisation dossier requirements should therefore be introduced in order to implement the Common Technical Document without delay. 
(4) The standardised marketing authorisation dossier requirements (harmonised format) should be applicable to any type of medicinal product for human use, regardless of the procedure for the granting of the marketing authorisation. Some medicinal products present, however, such specific features that all the requirements cannot be fulfilled. To take account of these particular situations, a simplified dossier presentation should be provided for. 
(5) The safety of biological medicinal products relies on rigorous control of their starting materials. Requirements for the suitability of human donors and the testing of donations of starting materials for plasma-derived medicinal products are laid down by Directive 2002/98/EC setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Directive 2001/83/EC. Article 109 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been amended. Plasma-derived medicinal products per se are biological medicinal products, the manufacture of which is based on the careful handling of human plasma as a starting material. To take account of the fact that the same plasma material is used in most cases for several medicinal products and, as a result, that a substantial part of the marketing authorisation dossier may be common to a great number of other dossiers for totally different plasma-derived medicinal products, it is appropriate to establish a new system aimed at simplifying procedures for both the approval of and subsequent changes to human plasma-derived medicinal products. To this end the concept of a plasma master file (PMF) should be introduced, in particular in order to allow the pooling of national expertise and through the coordination by the EMEA of a single evaluation. A PMF should serve as a stand-alone document, which is separate from the marketing authorisation dossier and through which a harmonised control of the relevant information regarding starting material used for the manufacture of plasma-derived medicinal products could be achieved. The PMF system should consist of a two-step assessment: first, an assessment of the PMF carried out at Community level, the result of which, i.e. a certificate of compliance with the Community legislation for each PMF, must be taken into account by any national competent authority, preventing them of any subsequent reassessment; second, an assessment of the finished plasma-derived medicinal product containing the modified part of the PMF (the two essential parts of the content, plasma origin and plasma quality-safety). This should remain the task of the competent authority that granted the marketing authorisation for the plasma-derived medicinal product. 
(6) In the case of vaccines for human use, the same antigen may be common to several medicinal products (vaccines) and any change to that particular antigen, ipso facto, may impact, therefore, on several vaccines authorised by different procedures. In order to simplify the existing procedures for the assessment of such vaccines, both for the granting of a first marketing authorisation and for subsequent changes to it due to modifications to the manufacturing process and testing of individual antigens involved in combined vaccines, a new system based on the concept of a vaccine antigen master file (VAMF) should be introduced. This VAMF will allow the pooling of national expertise, and through the coordination by the EMEA, a single evaluation of the concerned vaccine antigen. The VAMF should serve as a stand-alone part of the marketing authorisation dossier and provide all relevant information of a biological and chemical nature related to one specific antigen, which constitutes one of the active substances of one or several combined vaccines. 
(7) The VAMF system should consist of a two-step assessment: first, an assessment of the VAMF carried out at Community level, the result of which, i.e. a certificate of compliance with the Community legislation for each VAMF, must be taken into account by any national competent authority, preventing them from any subsequent reassessment; second, an assessment of the finished medicinal product (combined vaccine) containing the modified antigen which is the task of the competent authority that granted the combined vaccine marketing authorisation. 
(8) Herbal medicinal products differ substantially from conventional medicinal products in so far as they are intrinsically associated with the very particular notion of herbal substances and herbal preparations. It is therefore appropriate to determine specific requirements in respect of these products with regard to the standardised marketing authorisation requirements. 
(9) The treatment of various acquired and inherited pathological dysfunctions in humans calls upon novel concept-based approaches based on the development of biotechnology techniques. The latter involve the use of advanced therapy medicinal products based on processes focused on various gene-transfer-produced bio-molecules (gene therapy medicinal products) and manipulated or processed cells (cell therapy medicinal products) as active substances. 
(10) In so far as they achieve their essential action through metabolic, physiological and immunological means to restore, correct or modify physiological functions in humans, these novel complex therapeutic products representing a new category of biological medicinal products in the sense of Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 2001/83/EC. The general principles already applicable to these products should be specified from a scientific and technical point of view and the specific requirements with regard to the standardised marketing authorisation requirements should be determined. 
(11) Directive 2001/83/EC should be amended accordingly. 
(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use,

(1) The chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data that shall be provided shall include for the active substance(s) and for the finished medicinal product all of relevant information on: the development, the manufacturing process, the characterisation and properties, the quality control operations and requirements, the stability as well as a description of the composition and presentation of the finished medicinal product. 
(2) Two main sets of information shall be provided, dealing with the active substance(s) and with the finished medicinal product, respectively. 
(3) This Module shall in addition supply detailed information on the starting and raw materials used during the manufacturing operations of the active substance(s) and on the excipients incorporated in the formulation of the finished medicinal product. 
(4) All the procedures and methods used for manufacturing and controlling the active substance and the finished medicinal product shall be described in sufficient details to enable them to be repeated in control tests, carried out at the request of the competent authority. All test procedures shall correspond to the state of scientific progress at the time and shall be validated. Results of the validation studies shall be provided. In the case of test procedures included in the European Pharmacopoeia, this description shall be replaced by the appropriate detailed reference to the monograph(s) and general chapter(s). 
(5) The monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia shall be applicable to all substances, preparations and pharmaceutical forms appearing in it. In respect of other substances, each Member State may require observance of its own national pharmacopoeia. 
However, where a material in the European Pharmacopoeia or in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State has been prepared by a method liable to leave impurities not controlled in the pharmacopoeia monograph, these impurities and their maximum tolerance limits must be declared and a suitable test procedure must be described. In cases where a specification contained in a monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia or in the national pharmacopoeia of a Member State might be insufficient to ensure the quality of the substance, the competent authorities may request more appropriate specifications from the marketing authorisation holder. The competent authorities shall inform the authorities responsible for the pharmacopoeia in question. The marketing authorisation holder shall provide the authorities of that pharmacopoeia with the details of the alleged insufficiency and the additional specifications applied. 
In the case of analytical procedures included in the European Pharmacopoeia, this description shall be replaced in each relevant section by the appropriate detailed reference to the monograph(s) and general chapter(s). 
(6) In case where starting and raw materials, active substance(s) or excipient(s) are described neither in the European Pharmacopoeia nor in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State, compliance with the monograph of a third country pharmacopoeia can be accepted. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a copy of the monograph accompanied by the validation of the analytical procedures contained in the monograph and by a translation where appropriate. 
(7) Where the active substance and/or a raw and starting material or excipient(s) are the subject of a monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia, the applicant can apply for a certificate of suitability that, where granted by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, shall be presented in the relevant section of this Module. Those certificates of suitability of the monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia are deemed to replace the relevant data of the corresponding sections described in this Module. The manufacturer shall give the assurance in writing to the applicant that the manufacturing process has not been modified since the granting of the certificate of suitability by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. 
(8) For a well-defined active substance, the active substance manufacturer or the applicant may arrange for the 
(i) detailed description of the manufacturing process, 
(ii) quality control during manufacture, and 
(iii) process validation 
to be supplied in a separate document directly to the competent authorities by the manufacturer of the active substance as an Active Substance Master File. 
In this case, the manufacturer shall, however, provide the applicant with all of the data, which may be necessary for the latter to take responsibility for the medicinal product. The manufacturer shall confirm in writing to the applicant that he shall ensure batch to batch consistency and not modify the manufacturing process or specifications without informing the applicant. Documents and particulars supporting the application for such a change shall be supplied to the competent authorities; these documents and particulars will be also supplied to the applicant when they concern the open part of the active substance master file. 
(9) Specific measures concerning the prevention of the transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies (materials from ruminant origin): at each step of the manufacturing process, the applicant must demonstrate the compliance of the materials used with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products and its updates, published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union. Demonstration of compliance with the said Note for Guidance can be done by submitting either, preferably a certificate of suitability to the relevant monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia that has been granted by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines or by the supply of scientific data to substantiate this compliance. 
(10) For adventitious agents, information assessing the risk with respect to potential contamination with adventitious agents, whether they are non-viral or viral, as laid down in relevant guidelines as well as in relevant general monograph and general chapter of the European Pharmacopoeia, shall be provided. 
(11) Any special apparatus and equipment, which may be used at any stage of the manufacturing process and control operations of the medicinal product, shall be described in adequate details. 
(12) Where applicable and if needed, a CE marking which is required by Community legislation on medical devices shall be provided. 
Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. 
3.2.1. Active substance(s) 
3.2.1.1. General information and information related to the starting and raw materials 
a) Information on the nomenclature of the active substance shall be provided, including recommended International Non-proprietary Name (INN), European Pharmacopoeia name if relevant, chemical name(s). 
The structural formula, including relative and absolute stereo-chemistry, the molecular formula, and the relative molecular mass shall be provided. For biotechnological medicinal products if appropriate, the schematic amino acid sequence and relative molecular mass shall be provided. 
A list shall be provided of physicochemical and other relevant properties of the active substance, including biological activity for biological medicinal products. 
b) For the purposes of this Annex, starting materials shall mean all the materials from which the active substance is manufactured or extracted. 
For biological medicinal products, starting materials shall mean any substance of biological origin such as micro-organisms, organs and tissues of either plant or animal origin, cells or fluids (including blood or plasma) of human or animal origin, and biotechnological cell constructs (cell substrates, whether they are recombinant or not, including primary cells). 
A biological medicinal product is a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs for its characterisation and the determination of its quality a combination of physico-chemical-biological testing, together with the production process and its control. The following shall be considered as biological medicinal products: immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood and human plasma as defined, respectively in paragraphs (4) and (10) of Article 1; medicinal products falling within the scope of Part A of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93; advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Part IV of this Annex. 
Any other substances used for manufacturing or extracting the active substance(s) but from which this active substance is not directly derived, such as reagents, culture media, foetal calf serum, additives, and buffers involved in chromatography, etc. are known as raw materials.

4.2. Content: basic principles and requirements 
Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. 
(1) The pharmacological and toxicological tests must show: 
a) the potential toxicity of the product and any dangerous or undesirable toxic effects that may occur under the proposed conditions of use in human beings; these should be evaluated in relation to the pathological condition concerned; 
b) the pharmacological properties of the product, in both qualitative and quantitative relationship to the proposed use in human beings. All results must be reliable and of general applicability. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in evaluating the results. 
Additionally, it is necessary for clinicians to be given information about the therapeutic and toxicological potential of the product. 
(2) For biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma, the requirements of this Module may have to be adapted for individual products; therefore the testing program carried out shall be justified by the applicant. 
In establishing the testing program, the following shall be taken into consideration: 
all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and interference by, antibodies; 
examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and peri-natal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered. Where constituents other than the active substance(s) are incriminated, validation of their removal may replace the study. 
(3) The toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated. 
(4) Where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product, the toxicology of degradation products must be considered. 
4.2.1. Pharmacology 
Pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach. 
- Firstly, the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described. Where possible, recognised and validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, shall be used. Novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc. Wherever possible, comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar therapeutic action. 
- Secondly, the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological functions. These investigations shall be performed at exposures in the anticipated therapeutic range and above. The experimental techniques, unless they are standard procedures, must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator must establish their validity. Any suspected modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall be investigated. 
For the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction, tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharmacological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect. In the first case, the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combination of value in therapeutic use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the combination is sought through therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals, and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated. 
4.2.2. Pharmaco-kinetics 
Pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance, and its metabolites, within the organism, and covers the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism (bio-transformation) and excretion of these substances. 
The study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical, chemical or possibly by biological methods, and by observation of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself. 
Information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco-dynamic effects (e.g. numerous diagnostic agents, etc.). 
In vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material (i.e. protein binding, metabolism, drug-drug interaction). 
Pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances, which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be required, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission. 
The pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human. 
4.2.3. Toxicology 
a) Single-dose toxicity 
A single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions, which may result from a single administration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico-chemical state in which they are present in the actual product. 
The single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. 
b) Repeat-dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or anatomo-pathological changes induced by repeated administration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine how these changes are related to dosage. 
Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use. Its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attention should be paid in clinical studies. The duration is defined in the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. 
c) Geno-toxicity 
The purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells. Mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk of inducing germ-line mutation, with the possibility of inherited disorders, and the risk of somatic mutations including those leading to cancer. These studies are obligatory for any new substance. 
d) Carcino-genicity 
Tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required: 
1. These studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient's life, either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittent manner. 
2. These studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential, e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure, or from evidence in repeated dose toxicity studies. 
3. Studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed, as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. If such a medicinal product is intended to be administered chronically to humans a chronic study may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects. 
e) Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performed by appropriate tests. 
These tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female reproductive function, studies of the toxic and teratogenic effects at all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity as well as latent effects, when the medicinal product under investigation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. 
Omission of these tests must be adequately justified. 
Depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product, additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted. 
Embryo/foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species, one of which shall be other than a rodent. Peri- and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species. If the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man, it is desirable to include this species. It is also desirable that one of the species is the same as in the repeated dose toxicity studies. 
The state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the study design. 
f) Local tolerance 
The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products (both active substances and excipients) are tolerated at sites in the body, which may come into contact with the medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product can be distinguished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones. 
Local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use, using the vehicle and/or excipients in treating the control group(s). Positive controls/reference substances shall be included where necessary. 
The design of local tolerance tests (choice of species, duration, frequency and route of administration, doses) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions of administration in clinical use. Reversibility of local lesions shall be performed where relevant. 
Studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality and usefulness for the purpose of safety evaluation. 
For chemicals applied to the skin (e.g. dermal, rectal, vaginal) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available (the guinea pig assay or the local lymph node assay).

5.2.3. Reports of human pharmaco-kinetic studies 
a) The following pharmaco-kinetic characteristics shall be described: 
- absorption (rate and extent), 
- distribution, 
- metabolism, 
- excretion. 
Clinically significant features including the implication of the kinetic data for the dosage regimen especially for patients at risk, and differences between man and animal species used in the pre clinical studies, shall be described. 
In addition to standard multiple-sample pharmaco-kinetics studies, population pharmaco-kinetics analyses based on sparse sampling during clinical studies can also address questions about the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the variability in the dose- pharmaco-kinetics response relationship. Reports of pharmaco-kinetic and initial tolerability studies in healthy subjects and in patients, reports of pharmaco-kinetic studies to assess effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and reports of population pharmaco-kinetic studies shall be provided. 
b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modification of the pharmacological action. 
Pharmaco-kinetic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 
5.2.4. Reports of human pharmaco-dynamic studies 
a) The pharmaco-dynamic action correlated to the efficacy shall be demonstrated including: 
- the dose-response relationship and its time course, 
- justification for the dosage and conditions of administration, 
- the mode of action, if possible. 
The pharmaco-dynamic action not related to efficacy shall be described. 
The demonstration of pharmaco-dynamic effects in human beings shall not in itself be sufficient to justify conclusions regarding any particular potential therapeutic effect. 
b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modification of the pharmacological action. 
Pharmaco-dynamic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 
5.2.5. Reports of efficacy and safety studies 
5.2.5.1. Study Reports of Controlled Clinical Studies Pertinent to the Claimed Indication 
In general, clinical trials shall be done as %quot%controlled clinical trials%quot% if possible, randomised and as appropriate versus placebo and versus an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value; any other design shall be justified. The treatment of the control groups will vary from case to case and also will depend on ethical considerations and therapeutic area; thus it may, in some instances, be more pertinent to compare the efficacy of a new medicinal product with that of an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value rather than with the effect of a placebo. 
(1) As far as possible, and particularly in trials where the effect of the product cannot be objectively measured, steps shall be taken to avoid bias, including methods of randomisation and blinding. 
(2) The protocol of the trial must include a thorough description of the statistical methods to be employed, the number and reasons for inclusion of patients (including calculations of the power of the trial), the level of significance to be used and a description of the statistical unit. Measures taken to avoid bias, particularly methods of randomisation, shall be documented. Inclusion of a large number of subjects in a trial must not be regarded as an adequate substitute for a properly controlled trial. 
The safety data shall be reviewed taking into account guidelines published by the Commission, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increased risk shall be identified and particular attention paid to potentially vulnerable patients who may be present in small numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked abnormalities of metabolism or excretion etc. The implication of the safety evaluation for the possible uses of the medicinal product shall be described. 
5.2.5.2. Study reports of uncontrolled clinical studies reports of analyses of data from more than one study and other clinical study reports 
These reports shall be provided. 
5.2.6. Reports of post-marketing experience 
If the medicinal product is already authorised in third countries, information shall be given in respect of adverse reactions of the medicinal product concerned and medicinal products containing the same active substance(s), in relation to the usage rates if possible. 
5.2.7. Case reports forms and individual patient listings 
When submitted in accordance with the relevant Guideline published by the Agency, case report forms and individual patient data listings shall be provided and presented in the same order as the clinical study reports and indexed by study. 
PART II 
SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION DOSSIERS AND REQUIREMENTS 
Some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in Part I of this Annex need to be adapted. To take account of these particular situations, an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants. 
1. WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICINAL USE 
For medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have a %quot%well-established medicinal use%quot% as referred to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. 
The applicant shall submit Modules 1, 2 and 3 as described in part I of this Annex. 
For Modules 4 and 5, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics. 
The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use: 
a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are: 
- the time over which a substance has been used, 
- quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, 
- the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) and 
- the coherence of scientific assessments. 
Therefore different periods of time may be necessary for establishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well established medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and documented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community. 
b) The documentation submitted by the applicant should cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature concerning experience in the form of epidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documentation, both favourable and unfavourable, must be communicated. With respect to the provisions on %quot%well-established medicinal use%quot% it is in particular necessary to clarify that %quot%bibliographic reference%quot% to other sources of evidence (post marketing studies, epidemiological studies, etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product if an application explains and justifies the use of these sources of information satisfactorily. 
c) Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking. 
d) The non-clinical and/or clinical overviews must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketing authorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. 
e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue. 
2. ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
a) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (i) (essentially similar products) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex provided the applicant has been granted the consent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of his Modules 4 and 5. 
b) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex together with data showing bio-availability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal product provided the latter is not a biological medicinal product (see Part II, 4 Similar biological medicinal products). 
For these products the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements: 
- the grounds for claiming essential similarity; 
- a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage) as proposed for use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities; 
- an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on %quot%Investigation of Bio-availability and Bio-equivalence%quot%; 
- an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application. It may be acceptable for articles in %quot%peer review%quot% journals to be annotated for this purpose; 
- every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical/clinical overviews/summaries and substantiated by published literature and/or additional studies. 
- if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should be provided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity. 
3. ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS 
Where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt/ester complex/derivative evidence that there is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety, pharmaco-dynamics and/or in toxicity which could change the safety/efficacy profile shall be demonstrated. Should this not be the case, this association shall be considered as a new active substance. 
Where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered by different routes or in different doses or with a different posology, the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of clinical trials shall be provided. 
4. SIMILAR BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
The provisions of Article 10(1)(a) (iii) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products. If the information required in the case of essentially similar products (generics) does not permit the demonstration of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products, additional data, in particular, the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided. 
When a biological medicinal product as defined in Part I, paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, which refers to an original medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation in the Community, is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period, the following approach shall be applied. 
- Information to be supplied shall not be limited to Modules 1, 2 and 3 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data. The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical and appropriate clinical data) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. 
- Due to the diversity of biological medicinal products, the need for identified studies foreseen in Modules 4 and 5, shall be required by the competent authority, taking into account the specific characteristic of each individual medicinal product. 
The general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the Agency. In case the originally authorised medicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product claimed to be similar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. 
5. FIXED COMBINATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
Applications based upon Article 10 (1) (b) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previously authorised as a fixed combination medicinal product. 
For those applications a full dossier (Modules 1 to 5) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product. Where applicable, information regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitious agents, safety evaluation shall be provided. 
6. DOCUMENTATION FOR APPLICATIONS IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
When, as provided for in Article 22, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because: 
- the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or 
- in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or 
- it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information, 
marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obligations. 
These obligations may include the following: 
- the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile, 
- the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorised person, 
- the package leaflet and any medical information shall draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 
7. MIXED MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS 
Mixed marketing-authorisation applications shall mean marketing-authorisation application dossiers where Module 4 and/or 5 consists of a combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinical studies carried out by the applicant and of bibliographical references. All other Module(s) are in accordance with the structure described in Part I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed format presented by the applicant on a case by case basis.

Module 4 
It is appreciated that toxicity may be associated with a radiation dose. In diagnosis, this is a consequence of the use of radio-pharmaceuticals; in therapy, it is the property desired. The evaluation of safety and efficacy of radio-pharmaceuticals shall, therefore, address requirements for medicinal products and radiation dosimetry aspects. Organ/tissue exposure to radiation shall be documented. Absorbed radiation dose estimates shall be calculated according to a specified, internationally recognised system by a particular route of administration. 
Module 5 
The results of clinical trials shall be provided where applicable otherwise justified in the clinical overviews. 
2.2. Radio-pharmaceutical precursors for radio-labelling purposes 
In the specific case of a radio-pharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radio-labelling purposes, the primary objective shall be to present information which would address the possible consequences of poor radio-labeling efficiency or in vivo dissociation of the radio-labeled conjugate, i.e. questions related to the effects produced in the patient by free radio-nuclide. In addition, it is also necessary to present relevant information relating to occupational hazards, i.e. radiation exposure to hospital staff and to the environment. 
In particular, the following information where applicable shall be provided: 
Module 3 
The provisions of Module 3 shall apply to the registration of radio-pharmaceutical precursors as define above (indents a) to i)), where applicable. 
Module 4 
Concerning single dose and repeat dose toxicity, the results of studies carried out in conformity with the provisions related to good laboratory practice laid down in Council Directives 87/18/EEC and 88/320/EEC shall be provided, unless otherwise justified. 
Mutagenicity studies on the radio-nuclide are not considered to be useful in this particular case. 
Information relating to the chemical toxicity and disposition of the relevant %quot%cold%quot% nuclide shall be presented. 
Module 5 
Clinical information generated from clinical studies using on the precursor itself is not considered to be relevant in the specific case of a radio-pharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radio-labelling purposes. 
However, information demonstrating the clinical utility of the radio-pharmaceutical precursor when attached to relevant carrier molecules shall be presented. 
3. HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
This section sets out specific provisions on the application of Modules 3 and 4 to homeopathic medicinal products as defined in Article 1(5). 
Module 3 
The provisions of Module 3 shall apply to the documents submitted in accordance with Article 15 in the simplified registration of homeopathic medicinal products referred to in Article 14(1) as well as to the documents for authorisation of other homeopathic medicinal products referred to in Article 16(1) with the following modifications. 
a) Terminology 
The Latin name of the homeopathic stock described in the marketing authorisation application dossier must be in accordance with the Latin title of the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, by an official pharmacopoeia of a Member State. Where relevant the traditional name(s) used in each Member State shall be provided. 
b) Control of starting materials 
The particulars and documents on the starting materials, i.e. all of the materials used including raw materials and intermediates up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished medicinal product, accompanying the application shall be supplemented by additional data on the homeopathic stock. 
The general quality requirements shall apply to all of the starting and raw materials as well as intermediate steps of the manufacturing process up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished medicinal product. If possible, an assay is required if toxic components are present and if the quality cannot be controlled on final dilution to be incorporated because of the high dilution degree. Every step of the manufacturing process from the starting materials up to the final dilution to be incorporated into the finished medicinal product must be fully described. 
In case dilutions are involved, these dilution steps should be done in accordance with the homeopathicmanufacturing methods laid down in the relevant monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, by an official pharmacopoeia of a Member State. 
c) Control tests on the finished medicinal product 
The general quality requirements shall apply to the homeopathic finished medicinal products, any exception needs to be duly justified by the applicant. 
Identification and assay of all the toxicologically relevant constituents shall be carried out. If it can be justified that an identification and/or an assay on all the toxicologically relevant constituents is not possible e.g. due to their dilution in the finished medicinal product the quality shall be demonstrated by complete validation of the manufacturing and dilution process. 
d) Stability tests 
The stability of the finished medicinal product must be demonstrated. Stability data from the homeopathic stocks are generally transferable to dilutions/triturations obtained thereof. If no identification or assay of the active substance is possible due to the degree of dilution, stability data of the pharmaceutical form may be considered. 
Module 4 
The provisions of Module 4 shall apply to the simplified registration of homeopathic medicinal products referred to in Article 14(1) with the following specifications. 
Any missing information must be justified, e.g., justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety can be supported although some studies are lacking.

PART IV 
ADVANCED THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
Advanced therapy medicinal products are based on manufacturing processes focussed on various gene transfer-produced bio-molecules, and/or biologically advanced therapeutic modified cells as active substances or part of active substances. 
For those medicinal products the presentation of the Marketing Authorisation application dossier shall fulfil the format requirements as described in Part I of this Annex. 
Modules 1 to 5 shall apply. For Genetically Modified Organisms deliberate release in the environment, attention shall be paid to the persistence of the Genetically Modified Organisms in the recipient and to the possible replication and/or modification of the Genetically Modified Organisms when released in the environment. The information concerning the environmental risk should appear in the Annex to Module 1. 
1. GENE THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) 
For the purposes of this Annex, gene therapy medicinal product shall mean a product obtained through a set of manufacturing processes aimed at the transfer, to be performed either in vivo or ex vivo, of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic gene (i.e. a piece of nucleic acid), to human/animal cells and its subsequent expression in vivo. The gene transfer involves an expression system contained in a delivery system known as a vector, which can be of viral, as well as non-viral origin. The vector can also be included in a human or animal cell. 
1.1. Diversity of gene therapy medicinal products 
a) Gene therapy medicinal products based on allogeneic or xenogeneic cells 
The vector is ready-prepared and stored before its transfer into the host cells. 
The cells have been obtained previously and may be processed as a cell bank (bank collection or bank established from procurement of primary cells) with a limited viability. 
The cells genetically modified by the vector represent an active substance. 
Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished product. By essence, such a medicinal product is intended to be administered to a certain number of patients. 
b) Gene therapy medicinal products using autologous human cells 
The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector stored before its transfer into the autologous cells. 
Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. 
Those products are prepared from cells obtained from an individual patient. The cells are then genetically modified using a ready-prepared vector containing the appropriate gene that has been prepared in advance and that constitutes the active substance. The preparation is re-injected into the patient and is by definition intended to a single patient. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one intervention. 
c) Administration of ready-prepared vectors with inserted (prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic) genetic material 
The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector. 
Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. This type of medicinal product is intended to be administered to several patients. 
Transfer of genetic material may be carried out by direct injection of the ready-prepared vector to the recipients. 
1.2. Specific requirements regarding Module 3 
Gene therapy medicinal products include: 
- naked nucleic acid 
- complex nucleic acid or non viral vectors 
- viral vectors 
- genetically modified cells 
As for other medicinal products, one can identify the three main elements of the manufacturing process, i.e.: 
- starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured such as, gene of interest, expression plasmids, cell banks and virus stocks or non viral vector; 
- active substance: recombinant vector, virus, naked or complex plasmids, virus producing cells, in vitro genetically modified cells; 
- finished medicinal product: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. Depending on the type of gene therapy medicinal product, the route of administration and conditions of use may necessitate an ex vivo treatment of the cells of the patient (see 1.1.b). 
A special attention shall be paid to the following items: 
a) Information shall be provided on the relevant characteristics of the gene therapy medicinal product including its expression in the target cell population. Information concerning the source, construction, characterisation and verification of the encoding gene sequence including its integrity and stability shall be provided. Apart from therapeutic gene, the complete sequence of other genes, regulatory elements and the vector backbone shall be provided. 
b) Information concerning the characterisation of the vector used to transfer and deliver the gene shall be provided. This must include its physico-chemical characterisation and/or biological/immunological characterisation. 
For medicinal products that utilise a micro-organism such as bacteria or viruses to facilitate gene transfer (biological gene transfer), data on the pathogenesis of the parental strain and on its tropism for specific tissues and cell types as well as the cell cycle-dependence of the interaction shall be provided. 
For medicinal products that utilise non-biological means to facilitate gene transfer, the physico-chemical properties of the constituents individually and in combination shall be provided. 
c) The principles for cell banking or seed lot establishment and characterisation shall apply to gene transfer medicinal products as appropriate. 
d) The source of the cells hosting the recombinant vector shall be provided. 
The characteristics of the human source such as age, sex, results of microbiological and viral testing, exclusion criteria and country of origin shall be documented. 
For cells of animal origin, detailed information related to the following items shall be provided: 
- Sourcing of the animals 
- Animal husbandry and care 
- Transgenic animals (methods of creation, characterisation of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted gene) 
- Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals 
- Testing for infectious agents 
- Facilities 
- Control of starting and raw materials. 
Description of cell collection methodology including location, type of tissue, operating process, transportation, storage and traceability as well as controls carried out during the collection process shall be documented. 
e) The evaluation of the viral safety as well as the traceability of the products from the donor to the finished medicinal product, are an essential part of the documentation to be supplied. E.g., the presence of replication competent virus in stocks of non-replication competent viral vectors must be excluded. 
2. SOMATIC CELL THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) 
For the purposes of this Annex, somatic cell therapy medicinal products shall mean the use in humans of autologous (emanating from the patient himself), allogeneic (coming from another human being) or xenogeneic (coming from animals) somatic living cells, the biological characteristics of which have been substantially altered as a result of their manipulation to obtain a therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive effect through metabolic, pharmacological and immunological means. This manipulation includes the expansion or activation of autologous cell populations ex vivo (e.g., adoptive immuno-therapy), the use of allogeneic and xenogeneic cells associated with medical devices used ex vivo or in vivo (e.g., micro-capsules, intrinsic matrix scaffolds, bio-degradable or not). 
Specific requirements for cell therapy medicinal products regarding Module 3 
Somatic cell therapy medicinal products include: 
- Cells manipulated to modify their immunological, metabolic or other functional properties in qualitative or quantitative aspects; 
- Cells sorted, selected and manipulated and subsequently undergoing a manufacturing process in order to obtain the finished medicinal product; 
- Cells manipulated and combined with non-cellular components (e.g. biological or inert matrixes or medical devices) and exerting the principle intended action in the finished product; 
- Autologous cell derivatives expressed in vitro under specific culture conditions; 
- Cells genetically modified or otherwise manipulated to express previously unexpressed homologous or non-homologous functional properties. 
The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient (autologous situation) up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one single intervention. 
As for other medicinal products, the three elements of the manufacturing process are identified: 
- starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured, i.e., organs, tissues, body fluids or cells; 
- active substance: manipulated cells, cell lysates, proliferating cells and cells used in conjunction with inert matrixes and medical devices; 
- finished medicinal products: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. 
a) General information on active substance(s) 
The active substances of cell therapy medicinal products consist of cells which as a consequence of in vitro processing display prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic properties different from the original physiological and biological one. 
This section shall describe the type of cells and culture concerned. Tissues, organs or biological fluids from which cells are derived as well as the autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic nature of the donation and its geographical origin shall be documented. Collection of the cells, sampling and storage prior further processing shall be detailed. For allogeneic cells, special attention shall be paid to the very first step of the process, which covers selection of donors. The type of manipulation carried out and the physiological function of the cells that are used as active substance shall be provided. 
b) Information related to the starting materials of active substance(s) 
1. Human somatic cells 
Human somatic cell therapy medicinal products are made of a defined number (pool) of viable cells, which are derived from a manufacturing process starting either at the level of organs or tissues retrieved from a human being, or, at the level of a well defined cell bank system where the pool of cells relies on continuous cell lines. For the purposes of this chapter, active substance shall mean the seed pool of human cells and finished medicinal product shall mean seed pool of human cells formulated for the intended medical use. 
Starting materials and each step of the manufacturing process shall be fully documented including viral safety aspects. 
(1) Organs, tissues, body fluids and cells of human origin 
The characteristics of the human source such as age, sex, microbiological status, exclusion criteria and country of origin shall be documented. 
Description of sampling including site, type, operating process, pooling, transportation, storage and traceability as well as controls carried out on sampling shall be documented. 
(2) Cell banking systems 
Relevant requirements depicted in part I shall apply for the preparation and quality control of cell banking systems. This may essentially be the case for allogeneic or xenogeneic cells. 
(3) Ancillary materials or ancillary medical devices 
Information shall be provided on the use of any raw materials (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, culture media) or of possible ancillary products and medical devices e.g., cell sorting devices, biocompatible polymers, matrix, fibres, beads in terms of bio-compatibility, functionality as well as the risk of infectious agents. 
2. Animal somatic cells (xenogeneic) 
Detailed information related to the following items shall be provided: 
- Sourcing of the animals

b) Characterisation of active substance(s) 
All of the relevant information on the characterisation of the cell population of interest in terms of identity (species of origin, banding cytogenetics, morphological analysis), purity (adventitious microbial agents and cellular contaminants), potency (defined biological activity), and suitability (karyology and tumorigenicity tests) for the intended medicinal use shall be provided. 
c) Pharmaceutical development of finished medicinal product 
Apart from the specific method of administration used (intravenous infusion, site-injection, transplantation surgery), information shall also be provided on the use of possible ancillary medical devices (bio-compatible polymers, matrix, fibres, beads) in terms of bio-compatibility and durability. 
d) Traceability 
A detailed flow chart shall be provided insuring the traceability of the products from the donor to the finished medicinal product. 
3. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR GENE THERAPY AND SOMATIC CELL THERAPY (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) MEDICINAL PRODUCTS REGARDING MODULES 4 AND 5 
3.1. Module 4 
For gene and somatic cell therapy medicinal products, it is recognised that conventional requirements as laid down in Module 4 for non-clinical testing of medicinal products may not always be appropriate due to unique and diverse structural and biological properties of the products in question, including high degree of species specificity, subject specificity, immunological barriers and differences in pleiotropic responses. 
The rationale underpinning the non-clinical development and the criteria used to choose relevant species and models shall be properly captioned in Module 2. 
It may be necessary to identify or develop new animal models in order to assist in the extrapolation of specific findings on functional endpoints and toxicity to in vivo activity of the products in human beings. The scientific justification for the use of these animal models of disease to support safety and proof of concept for efficacy shall be provided. 
3.2. Module 5 
The efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products must be demonstrated as described in Module 5. For some products and for some therapeutic indications, however, it may not be possible to perform conventional clinical trials. Any deviation from the existing guidelines shall be justified in Module 2. 
The clinical development of advanced therapy medicinal products will have some special features owing to the complex and labile nature of the active substances. It requires additional considerations because of issues related to viability, proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells (somatic cell therapy), because of the special clinical circumstances where the products are used or because of the special mode of action through gene expression (somatic gene therapy). 
Special risks associated with such products arising from potential contamination with infectious agents must be addressed in the application for marketing authorisation for advanced therapy medicinal products. Special emphasis should be put on both the early stages of development in one hand, including the choice of donors in the case of cell therapy medicinal products, and on the therapeutic intervention as a whole, including the proper handling and administration of the product on the other hand. 
Furthermore, Module 5 of the application should contain, as relevant, data on the measures to surveying and control of the functions and development of living cells in the recipient, to prevent transmission of infectious agents to the recipient and to minimise any potential risks to public health. 
3.2.1. Human pharmacology and efficacy studies 
Human pharmacology studies should provide information on the expected mode of action, expected efficacy based on justified end-points, bio-distribution, adequate dose, schedule, and methods of administration or modality of use desirable for efficacy studies. 
Conventional pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be relevant for some advanced therapy products. Sometimes studies in healthy volunteers are not feasible and the establishment of dose and kinetics will be difficult to determine in clinical trials. It is necessary, however, to study the distribution and in vivo behaviour of the product including cell proliferation and long-term function as well as the extent, distribution of the gene product and duration of the desired gene expression. Appropriate tests shall be used and, if necessary, developed for the tracing of the cell product or cell expressing the desired gene in the human body and for the monitoring of the function of the cells that were administered or transfected. 
The assessment of the efficacy and safety of an advanced therapy medicinal product must include the careful description and evaluation of the therapeutic procedure as a whole, including special ways of administration, (such as transfection of cells ex vivo, in vitro manipulation, or use of interventional techniques), and testing of the possible associated regimens (including immuno-suppressive, antiviral, cytotoxic treatment). 
The whole procedure must be tested in clinical trials and described in the product information. 
3.2.2. Safety 
Safety issues arising from immune response to the medicinal products or to the expressed proteins, immune rejection, immuno-suppression, and breakdown of immuno-isolation devices shall be considered. 
Certain advanced gene therapy and somatic cell therapy medicinal products (e.g. xenogeneic cell therapy and certain gene transfer products) may contain replication-competent particles and/or infectious agents. The patient may have to be monitored for the development of possible infections and/or their pathological sequelae during pre- and/or post-authorisation phases; this surveillance may have to be extended to close contacts of the patient including health-care workers. 
The risk of contamination with potentially transmissible agents cannot be totally eliminated in the use of certain somatic cell therapy medicinal products and certain gene transfer medicinal products. The risk can be minimised, however, by appropriate measures as described in Module 3. 
The measures included in the production process must be complemented with accompanied testing methods, quality control processes and by appropriate surveillance methods that must be described in Module 5. 
The use of certain advanced somatic cell therapy medicinal products may have to be limited, temporarily or permanently, to establishments that have documented expertise and facilities for assuring a specific follow up of the safety of the patients. A similar approach may be relevant for certain gene therapy medicinal products that are associated with a potential risk of replication-competent infectious agents. 
The long term monitoring aspects for the development of late complications shall also be considered and addressed in the submission, where relevant. 
Where appropriate, the applicant has to submit a detailed risk management plan covering clinical and laboratory data of the patient, emerging epidemiological data, and, if relevant, data from archives of tissue samples from the donor and the recipient. Such a system is needed to ensure the traceability of the medicinal product and the rapid response to suspicious patterns of adverse events. 
4. SPECIFIC STATEMENT ON XENO-TRANSPLANTATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
For the purposes of this Annex, xeno-transplantation shall mean any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either live tissues or organs retrieved from animals, or, human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have undergone ex vivo contact with live non-human animal cells, tissues or organs. 
Specific emphasis shall be paid to the starting materials. 
In this respect, detailed information related to the following items shall be provided according to specific guidelines: 
- Sourcing of the animals 
- Animal husbandry and care 
- Genetically modified animals (methods of creation, characterisation of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted or excised (knock out) gene) 
- Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals 
- Testing for infectious agents 
- Facilities 
- Control of starting and raw materials 
- Traceability.
