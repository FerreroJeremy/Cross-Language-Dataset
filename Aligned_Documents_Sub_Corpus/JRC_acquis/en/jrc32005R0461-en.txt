In the event of a dispute, the analysis results shall be forwarded to the Commission. 
Reference samples for counter-analysis shall be taken and analysed within seven working days of the date of the successful tenderer's request or within three working days if the samples are taken on removal from storage. Where the final result of sample analyses indicates a quality: 
(a) higher than that specified in the notice of invitation to tender, the successful tenderer must accept the lot as established; 
(b) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, providing that the differences do not exceed the following limits: 
- one kilogram per hectolitre as regards specific weight, which must not, however, be less than 75 kg/hl,

- accept the lot as established, or 
- refuse to take over the lot concerned. The successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations relating to the lot in question and the securities shall be released provided the Commission and the intervention agency are immediately notified in accordance with Annex II; however, if the successful tenderer requests the intervention agency to supply another lot of intervention common wheat of the quality laid down at no additional charge, the security shall not be released. The lot must be replaced within three days of the date of the successful tenderer's request. The successful tenderer shall notify the Commission immediately thereof in accordance with Annex II; 
(d) below the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention, the successful tenderer may not remove the lot in question. The successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations relating to the lot in question and the securities shall be released provided the Commission and the intervention agency are immediately notified in accordance with Annex II; however, the successful tenderer may request the intervention agency to supply another lot of intervention common wheat of the quality laid down at no additional charge. In that case, the security shall not be released. The lot must be replaced within three days of the date of the successful tenderer's request. The successful tenderer shall immediately inform the Commission thereof in accordance with Annex II. 
2. However, if the common wheat is removed before the results of the analyses are known, all risks shall be borne by the successful tenderer from the time the lot is removed, without prejudice to any means of redress against the storer. 
3. If, as a result of successive replacements, the successful tenderer has not received a replacement lot of the quality laid down within one month of the date of the request for a replacement, the successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations and the securities shall be released, provided the Commission and the intervention agency have been immediately informed in accordance with Annex II.
