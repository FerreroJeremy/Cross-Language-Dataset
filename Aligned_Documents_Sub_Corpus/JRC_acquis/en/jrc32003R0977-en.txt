Commission Regulation (EC) No 977/2003 
of 6 June 2003 
opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for young male bovine animals for fattening (1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The WTO schedule CXL requires the Community to open an annual import tariff quota for 169000 head of young male bovine animals for fattening. Implementing rules should be laid down for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. 
(2) There should be a guarantee in particular of equal and continuing access to the said quota for all interested traders within the Community. However, pursuant to Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, the method of administration may give due weight to the supply requirements on the Community market. 
(3) The requirements of certain Member States which have a shortfall of bovine animals for fattening may therefore be taken into account. As those requirements are particularly evident in Italy and Greece, priority should be given to satisfying demand in those two Member States. 
(4) For the allocation of the tariff quota methods which have been applied in the past to this quota should be applied again. Consequently, in Italy and Greece the method referred to in the third indent of Article 32(2) should be applied while the method referred to in the second indent of that paragraph shall be used for applications in other Member States. 
(5) Importers who can show that they have been involved in trade with live animals with third countries should be able to apply for import rights. Proof of that involvement calls for evidence to be presented of recent import or export of some significance. 
(6) Checks of criteria for participation in the quota allocation call for applications to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is entered in the value added tax (VAT) register. Italy and Greece are an exception to this rule: traders entered in the VAT register of another Member State may submit their applications in these two countries. 
(7) In order to prevent speculation: 
- importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2003 should be denied access to the quota, 
- a security should be fixed for import rights, 
- licences should not be transferable, 
- import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights. 
(8) In order to provide for more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animal per application, each application should respect a maximum and a minimum number of heads. 
(9) To oblige traders to apply for import licences for all import rights allocated, it should be established that this obligation is a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(4). 
(10) With a view to using up quota quantities completely, a closing date should be set for the submission of import licence applications and provision should be made for a further allocation of quantities not covered by licence applications submitted by that date. In the light of experience it should also be laid down that this final allocation is open only to importers who have applied for import licences for the total quantity to which they are entitled. 
(11) A proper management of the quota requires the use of import licences. To that end, rules should be laid down in particular on the way applications are to be submitted and the information to be shown in applications and licences, where applicable by waiving or supplementing certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for certain agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(6), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 852/2003(8). 
(12) A proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security. 
(13) With a view of ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall not apply. 
(14) The application of this tariff quota requires effective checks on the specific destination of the imported animals. The animals should therefore be fattened in the Member State which has issued the import licence. 
(15) A security must be lodged to ensure that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question. 
(16) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

- lodged a security of an amount as laid down for each eligible CN code in Annex IV with the competent authority of the Member State that issued the licence. The fattening of the imported animals in that Member State for at least 120 days from the date of acceptance of the customs declaration of release for free circulation is a primary requirement within the meaning of Article 20(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85. 
2. Except in cases of force majeure, the security referred to in the second indent of paragraph 1 shall be released only if proof is furnished to the competent authority of the Member State that issued the licence that the young bovine animals: 
(a) have been fattened on the farm or farms indicated pursuant to paragraph 1; 
(b) have not been slaughtered before a period of 120 days from the date of import has elapsed; or 
(c) have been slaughtered for health reasons or have died as a result of sickness or accident before that period has elapsed. 
The security shall be released immediately after such proof has been furnished. 
However, where the time limit referred to in the first indent of paragraph 1 has not been observed, the security to be released shall be reduced by: 
- 15 %, and by 
- 2 % of the remaining amount for each day by which it has been exceeded. 
The amounts not released shall be forfeited and retained as customs duties. 
3. If the proof referred to in paragraph 2 is not furnished within 180 days from the date of import, the security shall be forfeited and retained as customs duty. 
However, if such proof is not furnished within 180 days but is produced within six months following the said period of 180 days, the amount forfeited, less 15 % of the security, shall be repaid. 
Article 9 
1. Animals not covered by import licence applications at 6 February 2004 shall be the subject of a further allocation of import rights, irrespective of the allocation of import rights between Member States referred to in Article 2(1) and of the two different schemes provided for in the first and second indents of Article 2(2). 
2. To that end, by 12 February 2004 at the latest the Member States shall notify the Commission of the number of animals referred to in paragraph 1. 
3. The Commission shall establish and publish as quickly as possible the total remaining number of animals to be reallocated. 
4. The allocation of those animals shall be open to interested operators who have applied for import licences for all their import rights initially granted. 
New applications for import rights shall be presented in the Member State where the applicant is entered in the national value added tax register. 
5. Each application shall relate to a minimum of 50 head and to a maximum of the available number of head referred to in paragraph 3. However, where the remaining number of animals is lower than 50 head, an application shall relate to that lower number of head. 
6. For the purposes of this Article, Articles 4 to 8 shall apply. However, the date of application mentioned in Article 4(2) shall be 27 February 2004 and the date of communication mentioned in Article 4(4) shall be 5 March 2004. 
Article 10 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
