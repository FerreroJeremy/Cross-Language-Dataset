Council Regulation (EC) No 1263/1999 of 21 June 1999 on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1263/1999 
of 21 June 1999 
on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
(1) Whereas the common fisheries policy supports the general objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty; whereas, in particular, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture(4), contributes towards achieving a balance between conservation and the management of resources, on the one hand, and fishing effort and the stable and rational exploitation of those resources, on the other; 
(2) Whereas structural measures in fisheries and aquaculture should contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the common fisheries policy and those of Article 100 of the Treaty; 
(3) Whereas the incorporation of such structural measures into the operational framework of the Structural Funds in 1993 improved the synergy of Community operations and enabled a more coherent contribution to be made to the strengthening of economic and social cohesion; 
(4) Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(5) institutes a comprehensive review of the operational arrangements for the structural policies to take effect from 1 January 2000; whereas such structural measures will form part of the means and tasks referred to in Article 2 of the said Regulation; whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2080/93 of 20 July 1993 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance(6) should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation providing in particular for arrangements that will ensure a transition which avoids any interruption of the structural measures,
