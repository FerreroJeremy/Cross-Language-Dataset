Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable compact disks (CD-Rs) originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia 
(2005/C 192/03) 
The Commission has received a complaint pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community ("the basic Regulation") [1], alleging that imports of recordable compact disks (CD-Rs), originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia ("the countries concerned"), are being dumped and are thereby causing material injury to the Community industry. 
1. Complaint 
The complaint was lodged on 24 June 2005 by CECMA ("the complainant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 60 %, of the total Community production of CD-Rs. 
2. Product 
The product allegedly being dumped is recordable compact disks (CD-Rs) originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia ("the product concerned"), normally declared within CN code ex85239000 (Taric 8523900010). This CN code is only given for information. 
3. Allegation of dumping 
The allegation of dumping for Hong Kong and Malaysia is based, in the absence of sufficient sales in the domestic market, on a comparison of a constructed normal value with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. 
In view of the provisions of Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, the complainant established normal value for the People's Republic of China on the basis of a constructed normal value in a market economy country, which is mentioned in point 5.1(d).The allegation of dumping is based on a comparison of normal value, thus calculated, with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. 
On this basis, the dumping margins calculated are significant for all exporting countries concerned. 
4. Allegation of injury 
The complainant has provided evidence that imports of the product concerned from the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia have increased overall in absolute terms and in terms of market share. 
It is alleged that the volumes and the prices of the imported product concerned have, among other consequences, had a negative impact on the quantities sold and the level of prices charged by the Community industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Community industry. 
5. Procedure 
Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the Community industry and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission hereby initiates an investigation pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. 
5.1. Procedure for the determination of dumping and injury 
The investigation will determine whether the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia is being dumped and whether this dumping has caused injury. 
(a) Sampling 
In view of the apparent large number of parties involved in this proceeding, the Commission may decide to apply sampling in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. 
(i) Sampling for exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporters/producers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the format indicated in point 7 of this notice: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in units of the product concerned sold for export to the Community during the 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the turnover in local currency and the sales volume in units for the product concerned on the domestic market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- whether the company intends to claim an individual margin [2] (individual margins can only be claimed by producers), 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the production of the product concerned, 
- the names and the precise activities of all related companies [3] involved in the production and/or selling (export and/or domestic) of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of exporters/producers, the Commission will, in addition, contact the authorities of the exporting countries, and any known associations of exporters/producers. 
(ii) Sampling for importers 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all importers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the formats indicated in point 7: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, 
- the total turnover in euro of the company during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the total number of employees, 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the product concerned, 
- the volume in units and value in euro of imports into and resales made in the Community market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 of the imported product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia, 
- the names and the precise activities of all related companies [3] involved in the production and/or selling of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of importers, the Commission will, in addition, contact any known associations of importers. 
(iii) Final selection of the samples 
All interested parties wishing to submit any relevant information regarding the selection of the samples must do so within the time limit set in point 6(b)(ii). 
The Commission intends to make the final selection of the samples after having consulted the parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample. 
Companies included in the samples must reply to a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(b)(iii) and must cooperate within the framework of the investigation. 
If sufficient co-operation is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings, in accordance with Articles 17(4) and 18 of the basic Regulation, on the facts available. A finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party concerned, as explained in point 8. 
(b) Questionnaires 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the Community industry and to any association of producers in the Community, to the sampled exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong, to the exporters/producers in Malaysia, to any association of exporters/producers, to the sampled importers, to any association of importers named in the complaint, and to the authorities of the exporting countries concerned. 
(i) Exporters/producers in Malaysia 
All such interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith by fax, but not later than the time limit set out in point 6(a)(i), in order to find out whether they are listed in the complaint and, if necessary, request a questionnaire, given that the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii) applies to all such interested parties. 
(ii) Exporters/producers claiming an individual margin in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong 
Exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong claiming an individual margin, with a view to the application of Articles 17(3) and 9(6) of the basic Regulation, must submit a completed questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii) of this notice. They therefore have to request a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(a)(i). However, such parties should be aware that if sampling is applied to exporters/producers, the Commission may nonetheless decide not to calculate an individual margin for them, if the number of exporters/producers is so large that individual examination would be unduly burdensome and would prevent the timely completion of the investigation. 
(c) Collection of information and holding of hearings 
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known, submit information other than questionnaire replies and to provide supporting evidence. This information and supporting evidence has to reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii). 
Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. This request must be made within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). 
(d) Selection of the market economy country 
In accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, it is envisaged to choose Malaysia as an appropriate market economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People's Republic of China. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in point 6(c). 
(e) Market economy status 
For those exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China who claim and provide sufficient evidence that they operate under market economy conditions, i.e. that they meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. Exporters/producers intending to submit duly substantiated claims must do so within the specific time limit set in point 6(d). The Commission will send claim forms to all exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China named in the complaint and to any association of exporters/producers named in the complaint, where addresses are available as well as to the authorities of the People's Republic of China. 
5.2. Procedure for assessment of Community interest 
In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation and in the event that the allegations of dumping and injury caused thereby are substantiated, a decision will be reached as to whether the adoption of anti-dumping measures would not be against the Community interest. For this reason the Community industry, importers, their representative associations, representative users and representative consumer organisations, provided that they prove that there is an objective link between their activity and the product concerned, may, within the general time limits set in point 6(a)(ii), make themselves known and provide the Commission with information. The parties which have acted in conformity with the precedent sentence may request a hearing setting the particular reasons why they should be heard within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). It should be noted that any information submitted pursuant to Article 21 will only be taken into account if supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. 
6. Time limits 
(a) General time limits
