Council Regulation (EC) No 2319/2003 
of 17 December 2003 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92(3), the Community Tobacco Fund is to be financed by deductions of 2 % and 3 % respectively from the premiums for the 2002 and 2003 harvests. 
(2) The reform of the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco, which also covers the Community Tobacco Fund, is currently being drawn up. The new rules are not due to take effect until 2005. A deduction percentage therefore needs to be set for 2004, and in the transitional context it should be maintained at the same level as in 2003. 
(3) According to the conclusions of the report on utilisation of the Community Tobacco Fund presented by the Commission to the Council pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92, a 3 % deduction will be sufficient to cover the fund's prospective expenditure. 
(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 therefore needs to be amended,
