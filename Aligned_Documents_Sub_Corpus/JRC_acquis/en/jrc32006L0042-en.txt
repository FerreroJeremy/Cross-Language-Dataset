Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (recast) (Text with EEA relevance) 
Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 17 May 2006 
on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (recast) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3], 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 98/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to machinery [4] codified Directive 89/392/EEC [5]. Now that new substantial amendments are being made to Directive 98/37/EC, it is desirable, in order to clarify matters, that that Directive should be recast. 
(2) The machinery sector is an important part of the engineering industry and is one of the industrial mainstays of the Community economy. The social cost of the large number of accidents caused directly by the use of machinery can be reduced by inherently safe design and construction of machinery and by proper installation and maintenance. 
(3) Member States are responsible for ensuring the health and safety on their territory of persons, in particular of workers and consumers and, where appropriate, of domestic animals and goods, notably in relation to the risks arising out of the use of machinery. 
(4) In order to ensure legal certainty for users, the scope of this Directive and the concepts relating to its application should be defined as precisely as possible. 
(5) The Member States' mandatory provisions governing construction site hoists intended for lifting persons or persons and goods, which are often supplemented by de facto compulsory technical specifications and/or by voluntary standards, do not necessarily lead to different levels of health and safety but, because of their disparities, do nevertheless constitute barriers to trade within the Community. Moreover, the national systems for the conformity assessment and certification of these machines diverge considerably. It is therefore desirable not to exclude from the scope of this Directive construction site hoists intended for lifting persons or persons and goods. 
(6) It is appropriate to exclude from the scope of this Directive weapons, including firearms, that are subject to Council Directive 91/477/EEC of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons [6]; the exclusion of firearms should not apply to portable cartridge-operated fixing and other impact machinery designed for industrial or technical purposes only. It is necessary to provide for transitional arrangements enabling Member States to authorise the placing on the market and putting into service of such machinery manufactured in accordance with national provisions in force upon adoption of this Directive, including those implementing the Convention of 1 July 1969 on the Reciprocal Recognition of Proofmarks on Small Arms. Such transitional arrangements will also enable the European standardisation organisations to draft standards ensuring the safety level based on the state of the art. 
(7) This Directive does not apply to the lifting of persons by means of machines not designed for the lifting of persons. However, this does not affect the right of Member States to take national measures, in accordance with the Treaty, with respect to such machines, with a view to implementing Council Directive 89/655/EEC of 30 November 1989 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work (second individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [7]. 
(8) In relation to agricultural and forestry tractors, the provisions of this Directive concerning the risks currently not covered by Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units [8] should no longer apply when such risks are covered by Directive 2003/37/EC. 
(9) Market surveillance is an essential instrument inasmuch as it ensures the proper and uniform application of Directives. It is therefore appropriate to put in place the legal framework within which market surveillance can proceed harmoniously. 
(10) Member States are responsible for ensuring that this Directive is effectively enforced on their territory and that the safety of the machinery concerned is, as far as possible, improved in accordance with its provisions. Member States should ensure their capacity to carry out effective market surveillance, taking account of guidelines developed by the Commission, in order to achieve the proper and uniform application of this Directive. 
(11) In the context of market surveillance, a clear distinction should be established between the disputing of a harmonised standard conferring a presumption of conformity on machinery and the safeguard clause relating to machinery. 
(12) The putting into service of machinery within the meaning of this Directive can relate only to the use of the machinery itself for its intended purpose or for a purpose which can reasonably be foreseen. This does not preclude the laying down of conditions of use external to the machinery, provided that it is not thereby modified in a way not specified in this Directive. 
(13) It is also necessary to provide for an adequate mechanism allowing for the adoption of specific measures at Community level requiring Member States to prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of certain types of machinery presenting the same risks to the health and safety of persons either due to shortcomings in the relevant harmonised standard(s) or by virtue of their technical characteristics, or to make such machinery subject to special conditions. In order to ensure the appropriate assessment of the need for such measures, they should be taken by the Commission, assisted by a committee, in the light of consultations with the Member States and other interested parties. Since such measures are not directly applicable to economic operators, Member States should take all necessary measures for their implementation. 
(14) The essential health and safety requirements should be satisfied in order to ensure that machinery is safe; these requirements should be applied with discernment to take account of the state of the art at the time of construction and of technical and economic requirements. 
(15) Where the machinery may be used by a consumer, that is to say, a non-professional operator, the manufacturer should take account of this in the design and construction. The same applies where a machine is normally used to provide a service to a consumer. 
(16) Although the requirements of this Directive do not apply to partly completed machinery in their entirety, it is nevertheless important that the free movement of such machinery be guaranteed by means of a specific procedure. 
(17) For trade fairs, exhibitions and such like, it should be possible to exhibit machinery which does not satisfy the requirements of this Directive. However, interested parties should be properly informed that the machinery does not conform and cannot be purchased in that condition. 
(18) This Directive defines only the essential health and safety requirements of general application, supplemented by a number of more specific requirements for certain categories of machinery. In order to help manufacturers to prove conformity to these essential requirements, and to allow inspection of conformity to the essential requirements, it is desirable to have standards that are harmonised at Community level for the prevention of risks arising out of the design and construction of machinery. These standards are drawn up by private-law bodies and should retain their non-binding status. 
(19) In view of the nature of the risks involved in the use of machinery covered by this Directive, procedures for assessing conformity to the essential health and safety requirements should be established. These procedures should be devised in the light of the extent of the danger inherent in such machinery. Consequently, each category of machinery should have its appropriate procedure in conformity with Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives [9], taking account of the nature of the verification required for such machinery. 
(20) Manufacturers should retain full responsibility for certifying the conformity of their machinery to the provisions of this Directive. Nevertheless, for certain types of machinery having a higher risk factor, a stricter certification procedure is desirable. 
(21) The CE marking should be fully recognised as being the only marking which guarantees that machinery conforms to the requirements of this Directive. All other markings which are likely to mislead third parties as to the meaning or the form of the CE marking, or both, should be prohibited. 
(22) In order to ensure the same quality for the CE marking and the manufacturer's mark, it is important that they be affixed according to the same techniques. In order to avoid confusion between any CE markings which might appear on certain components and the CE marking corresponding to the machinery, it is important that the latter marking be affixed alongside the name of the person who has taken responsibility for it, namely the manufacturer or his authorised representative. 
(23) The manufacturer or his authorised representative should also ensure that a risk assessment is carried out for the machinery which he wishes to place on the market. For this purpose, he should determine which are the essential health and safety requirements applicable to his machinery and in respect of which he must take measures. 
(24) It is essential that, before drawing up the EC declaration of conformity, the manufacturer or his authorised representative established in the Community should prepare a technical construction file. However, it is not essential that all documentation should be permanently available in material form, but it must be possible to make it available on request. It need not include detailed plans of subassemblies used for the manufacture of machinery, unless knowledge of such plans is essential in order to ascertain conformity with the essential health and safety requirements. 
(25) The addressees of any decision taken under this Directive should be informed of the reasons for such a decision and of the legal remedies open to them. 
(26) Member States should provide for penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 
(27) The application of this Directive to a number of machines intended for lifting persons requires a better delimitation of the products covered by this Directive with respect to those covered by Directive 95/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 1995 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts [10]. A redefinition of the scope of the latter Directive is thus deemed necessary. Directive 95/16/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(28) Since the objective of this Directive, namely, to lay down the essential health and safety requirements in relation to design and manufacture in order to improve the safety of machinery placed on the market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 
(29) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making [11], Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public. 
(30) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [12],

8. A Member State which has notified a body shall immediately withdraw its notification if it finds: 
(a) that the body no longer meets the criteria set out in Annex XI; or 
(b) that the body seriously fails to fulfil its responsibilities. 
The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly. 
Article 15 
Installation and use of machinery 
This Directive shall not affect Member States' entitlement to lay down, in due observance of Community law, such requirements as they may deem necessary to ensure that persons, and in particular workers, are protected when using machinery, provided that this does not mean that such machinery is modified in a way not specified in this Directive. 
Article 16 
CE marking 
1. The CE conformity marking shall consist of the initials %quot%CE%quot% as shown in Annex III. 
2. The CE marking shall be affixed to the machinery visibly, legibly and indelibly in accordance with Annex III. 
3. The affixing on machinery of markings, signs and inscriptions which are likely to mislead third parties as to the meaning or form of the CE marking, or both, shall be prohibited. Any other marking may be affixed to the machinery provided that the visibility, legibility and meaning of the CE marking is not thereby impaired. 
Article 17 
Non-conformity of marking 
1. Member States shall consider the following marking not to conform: 
(a) the affixing of the CE marking pursuant to this Directive on products not covered by this Directive;

ANNEX I 
Essential health and safety requirements relating to the the design and construction of machinery 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
1. The manufacturer of machinery or his authorised representative must ensure that a risk assessment is carried out in order to determine the health and safety requirements which apply to the machinery. The machinery must then be designed and constructed taking into account the results of the risk assessment. 
By the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction referred to above, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall: 
- determine the limits of the machinery, which include the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof, 
- identify the hazards that can be generated by the machinery and the associated hazardous situations, 
- estimate the risks, taking into account the severity of the possible injury or damage to health and the probability of its occurrence, 
- evaluate the risks, with a view to determining whether risk reduction is required, in accordance with the objective of this Directive, 
- eliminate the hazards or reduce the risks associated with these hazards by application of protective measures, in the order of priority established in section 1.1.2(b). 
2. The obligations laid down by the essential health and safety requirements only apply when the corresponding hazard exists for the machinery in question when it is used under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer or his authorised representative or in foreseeable abnormal situations. In any event, the principles of safety integration referred to in section 1.1.2 and the obligations concerning marking of machinery and instructions referred to in sections 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 apply. 
3. The essential health and safety requirements laid down in this Annex are mandatory; However, taking into account the state of the art, it may not be possible to meet the objectives set by them. In that event, the machinery must, as far as possible, be designed and constructed with the purpose of approaching these objectives. 
4. This Annex is organised in several parts. The first one has a general scope and is applicable to all kinds of machinery. The other parts refer to certain kinds of more specific hazards. Nevertheless, it is essential to examine the whole of this Annex in order to be sure of meeting all the relevant essential requirements. When machinery is being designed, the requirements of the general part and the requirements of one or more of the other parts shall be taken into account, depending on the results of the risk assessment carried out in accordance with point 1 of these General Principles. 
1. ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 
1.1. GENERAL REMARKS 
1.1.1. Definitions 
For the purpose of this Annex: 
(a) %quot%hazard%quot% means a potential source of injury or damage to health; 
(b) %quot%danger zone%quot% means any zone within and/or around machinery in which a person is subject to a risk to his health or safety; 
(c) %quot%exposed person%quot% means any person wholly or partially in a danger zone; 
(d) %quot%operator%quot% means the person or persons installing, operating, adjusting, maintaining, cleaning, repairing or moving machinery; 
(e) %quot%risk%quot% means a combination of the probability and the degree of an injury or damage to health that can arise in a hazardous situation; 
(f) %quot%guard%quot% means a part of the machinery used specifically to provide protection by means of a physical barrier; 
(g) %quot%protective device%quot% means a device (other than a guard) which reduces the risk, either alone or in conjunction with a guard; 
(h) %quot%intended use%quot% means the use of machinery in accordance with the information provided in the instructions for use; 
(i) %quot%reasonably foreseeable misuse%quot% means the use of machinery in a way not intended in the instructions for use, but which may result from readily predictable human behaviour. 
1.1.2. Principles of safety integration 
(a) Machinery must be designed and constructed so that it is fitted for its function, and can be operated, adjusted and maintained without putting persons at risk when these operations are carried out under the conditions foreseen but also taking into account any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. 
The aim of measures taken must be to eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable lifetime of the machinery including the phases of transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping. 
(b) In selecting the most appropriate methods, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must apply the following principles, in the order given: 
- eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe machinery design and construction), 
- take the necessary protective measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated, 
- inform users of the residual risks due to any shortcomings of the protective measures adopted, indicate whether any particular training is required and specify any need to provide personal protective equipment. 
(c) When designing and constructing machinery and when drafting the instructions, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must envisage not only the intended use of the machinery but also any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. 
The machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent abnormal use if such use would engender a risk. Where appropriate, the instructions must draw the user's attention to ways — which experience has shown might occur — in which the machinery should not be used. 
(d) Machinery must be designed and constructed to take account of the constraints to which the operator is subject as a result of the necessary or foreseeable use of personal protective equipment. 
(e) Machinery must be supplied with all the special equipment and accessories essential to enable it to be adjusted, maintained and used safely. 
1.1.3. Materials and products 
The materials used to construct machinery or products used or created during its use must not endanger persons' safety or health. In particular, where fluids are used, machinery must be designed and constructed to prevent risks due to filling, use, recovery or draining. 
1.1.4. Lighting 
Machinery must be supplied with integral lighting suitable for the operations concerned where the absence thereof is likely to cause a risk despite ambient lighting of normal intensity. 
Machinery must be designed and constructed so that there is no area of shadow likely to cause nuisance, that there is no irritating dazzle and that there are no dangerous stroboscopic effects on moving parts due to the lighting. 
Internal parts requiring frequent inspection and adjustment, and maintenance areas must be provided with appropriate lighting. 
1.1.5. Design of machinery to facilitate its handling 
Machinery, or each component part thereof, must: 
- be capable of being handled and transported safely, 
- be packaged or designed so that it can be stored safely and without damage. 
During the transportation of the machinery and/or its component parts, there must be no possibility of sudden movements or of hazards due to instability as long as the machinery and/or its component parts are handled in accordance with the instructions. 
Where the weight, size or shape of machinery or its various component parts prevents them from being moved by hand, the machinery or each component part must: 
- either be fitted with attachments for lifting gear, or 
- be designed so that it can be fitted with such attachments, or 
- be shaped in such a way that standard lifting gear can easily be attached. 
Where machinery or one of its component parts is to be moved by hand, it must: 
- either be easily moveable, or 
- be equipped for picking up and moving safely. 
Special arrangements must be made for the handling of tools and/or machinery parts which, even if lightweight, could be hazardous. 
1.1.6. Ergonomics 
Under the intended conditions of use, the discomfort, fatigue and physical and psychological stress faced by the operator must be reduced to the minimum possible, taking into account ergonomic principles such as: 
- allowing for the variability of the operator's physical dimensions, strength and stamina, 
- providing enough space for movements of the parts of the operator's body, 
- avoiding a machine-determined work rate, 
- avoiding monitoring that requires lengthy concentration, 
- adapting the man/machinery interface to the foreseeable characteristics of the operators. 
1.1.7. Operating positions 
The operating position must be designed and constructed in such a way as to avoid any risk due to exhaust gases and/or lack of oxygen. 
If the machinery is intended to be used in a hazardous environment presenting risks to the health and safety of the operator or if the machinery itself gives rise to a hazardous environment, adequate means must be provided to ensure that the operator has good working conditions and is protected against any foreseeable hazards. 
Where appropriate, the operating position must be fitted with an adequate cabin designed, constructed and/or equipped to fulfil the above requirements. The exit must allow rapid evacuation. Moreover, when applicable, an emergency exit must be provided in a direction which is different from the usual exit. 
1.1.8. Seating 
Where appropriate and where the working conditions so permit, work stations constituting an integral part of the machinery must be designed for the installation of seats. 
If the operator is intended to sit during operation and the operating position is an integral part of the machinery, the seat must be provided with the machinery. 
The operator's seat must enable him to maintain a stable position. Furthermore, the seat and its distance from the control devices must be capable of being adapted to the operator. 
If the machinery is subject to vibrations, the seat must be designed and constructed in such a way as to reduce the vibrations transmitted to the operator to the lowest level that is reasonably possible. The seat mountings must withstand all stresses to which they can be subjected. Where there is no floor beneath the feet of the operator, footrests covered with a slip-resistant material must be provided. 
1.2. CONTROL SYSTEMS 
1.2.1. Safety and reliability of control systems 
Control systems must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from arising. Above all, they must be designed and constructed in such a way that: 
- they can withstand the intended operating stresses and external influences, 
- a fault in the hardware or the software of the control system does not lead to hazardous situations, 
- errors in the control system logic do not lead to hazardous situations, 
- reasonably foreseeable human error during operation does not lead to hazardous situations. 
Particular attention must be given to the following points: 
- the machinery must not start unexpectedly, 
- the parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled way, where such change may lead to hazardous situations, 
- the machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the stop command has already been given, 
- no moving part of the machinery or piece held by the machinery must fall or be ejected, 
- automatic or manual stopping of the moving parts, whatever they may be, must be unimpeded, 
- the protective devices must remain fully effective or give a stop command, 
- the safety-related parts of the control system must apply in a coherent way to the whole of an assembly of machinery and/or partly completed machinery. 
For cable-less control, an automatic stop must be activated when correct control signals are not received, including loss of communication. 
1.2.2. Control devices 
Control devices must be: 
- clearly visible and identifiable, using pictograms where appropriate, 
- positioned in such a way as to be safely operated without hesitation or loss of time and without ambiguity, 
- designed in such a way that the movement of the control device is consistent with its effect, 
- located outside the danger zones, except where necessary for certain control devices such as an emergency stop or a teach pendant, 
- positioned in such a way that their operation cannot cause additional risk, 
- designed or protected in such a way that the desired effect, where a hazard is involved, can only be achieved by a deliberate action, 
- made in such a way as to withstand foreseeable forces; particular attention must be paid to emergency stop devices liable to be subjected to considerable forces. 
Where a control device is designed and constructed to perform several different actions, namely where there is no one-to-one correspondence, the action to be performed must be clearly displayed and subject to confirmation, where necessary. 
Control devices must be so arranged that their layout, travel and resistance to operation are compatible with the action to be performed, taking account of ergonomic principles. 
Machinery must be fitted with indicators as required for safe operation. The operator must be able to read them from the control position. 
From each control position, the operator must be able to ensure that no-one is in the danger zones, or the control system must be designed and constructed in such a way that starting is prevented while someone is in the danger zone. 
If neither of these possibilities is applicable, before the machinery starts, an acoustic and/or visual warning signal must be given. The exposed persons must have time to leave the danger zone or prevent the machinery starting up. 
If necessary, means must be provided to ensure that the machinery can be controlled only from control positions located in one or more predetermined zones or locations. 
Where there is more than one control position, the control system must be designed in such a way that the use of one of them precludes the use of the others, except for stop controls and emergency stops. 
When machinery has two or more operating positions, each position must be provided with all the required control devices without the operators hindering or putting each other into a hazardous situation. 
1.2.3. Starting 
It must be possible to start machinery only by voluntary actuation of a control device provided for the purpose. 
The same requirement applies: 
- when restarting the machinery after a stoppage, whatever the cause, 
- when effecting a significant change in the operating conditions. 
However, the restarting of the machinery or a change in operating conditions may be effected by voluntary actuation of a device other than the control device provided for the purpose, on condition that this does not lead to a hazardous situation. 
For machinery functioning in automatic mode, the starting of the machinery, restarting after a stoppage, or a change in operating conditions may be possible without intervention, provided this does not lead to a hazardous situation. 
Where machinery has several starting control devices and the operators can therefore put each other in danger, additional devices must be fitted to rule out such risks. If safety requires that starting and/or stopping must be performed in a specific sequence, there must be devices which ensure that these operations are performed in the correct order. 
1.2.4. Stopping 
1.2.4.1. Normal stop 
Machinery must be fitted with a control device whereby the machinery can be brought safely to a complete stop. 
Each workstation must be fitted with a control device to stop some or all of the functions of the machinery, depending on the existing hazards, so that the machinery is rendered safe. 
The machinery's stop control must have priority over the start controls. 
Once the machinery or its hazardous functions have stopped, the energy supply to the actuators concerned must be cut off. 
1.2.4.2. Operational stop 
Where, for operational reasons, a stop control that does not cut off the energy supply to the actuators is required, the stop condition must be monitored and maintained. 
1.2.4.3. Emergency stop 
Machinery must be fitted with one or more emergency stop devices to enable actual or impending danger to be averted. 
The following exceptions apply: 
- machinery in which an emergency stop device would not lessen the risk, either because it would not reduce the stopping time or because it would not enable the special measures required to deal with the risk to be taken, 
- portable hand-held and/or hand-guided machinery. 
The device must: 
- have clearly identifiable, clearly visible and quickly accessible control devices, 
- stop the hazardous process as quickly as possible, without creating additional risks, 
- where necessary, trigger or permit the triggering of certain safeguard movements. 
Once active operation of the emergency stop device has ceased following a stop command, that command must be sustained by engagement of the emergency stop device until that engagement is specifically overridden; it must not be possible to engage the device without triggering a stop command; it must be possible to disengage the device only by an appropriate operation, and disengaging the device must not restart the machinery but only permit restarting. 
The emergency stop function must be available and operational at all times, regardless of the operating mode. 
Emergency stop devices must be a back-up to other safeguarding measures and not a substitute for them. 
1.2.4.4. Assembly of machinery 
In the case of machinery or parts of machinery designed to work together, the machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that the stop controls, including the emergency stop devices, can stop not only the machinery itself but also all related equipment, if its continued operation may be dangerous. 
1.2.5. Selection of control or operating modes 
The control or operating mode selected must override all other control or operating modes, with the exception of the emergency stop. 
If machinery has been designed and constructed to allow its use in several control or operating modes requiring different protective measures and/or work procedures, it must be fitted with a mode selector which can be locked in each position. Each position of the selector must be clearly identifiable and must correspond to a single operating or control mode. 
The selector may be replaced by another selection method which restricts the use of certain functions of the machinery to certain categories of operator. 
If, for certain operations, the machinery must be able to operate with a guard displaced or removed and/or a protective device disabled, the control or operating mode selector must simultaneously: 
- disable all other control or operating modes, 
- permit operation of hazardous functions only by control devices requiring sustained action, 
- permit the operation of hazardous functions only in reduced risk conditions while preventing hazards from linked sequences, 
- prevent any operation of hazardous functions by voluntary or involuntary action on the machine's sensors. 
If these four conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously, the control or operating mode selector must activate other protective measures designed and constructed to ensure a safe intervention zone. 
In addition, the operator must be able to control operation of the parts he is working on from the adjustment point. 
1.2.6. Failure of the power supply 
The interruption, the re-establishment after an interruption or the fluctuation in whatever manner of the power supply to the machinery must not lead to dangerous situations. 
Particular attention must be given to the following points: 
- the machinery must not start unexpectedly, 
- the parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled way when such change can lead to hazardous situations, 
- the machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the command has already been given, 
- no moving part of the machinery or piece held by the machinery must fall or be ejected, 
- automatic or manual stopping of the moving parts, whatever they may be, must be unimpeded, 
- the protective devices must remain fully effective or give a stop command. 
1.3. PROTECTION AGAINST MECHANICAL HAZARDS 
1.3.1. Risk of loss of stability 
Machinery and its components and fittings must be stable enough to avoid overturning, falling or uncontrolled movements during transportation, assembly, dismantling and any other action involving the machinery. 
If the shape of the machinery itself or its intended installation does not offer sufficient stability, appropriate means of anchorage must be incorporated and indicated in the instructions. 
1.3.2. Risk of break-up during operation 
The various parts of machinery and their linkages must be able to withstand the stresses to which they are subject when used. 
The durability of the materials used must be adequate for the nature of the working environment foreseen by the manufacturer or his authorised representative, in particular as regards the phenomena of fatigue, ageing, corrosion and abrasion. 
The instructions must indicate the type and frequency of inspections and maintenance required for safety reasons. They must, where appropriate, indicate the parts subject to wear and the criteria for replacement. 
Where a risk of rupture or disintegration remains despite the measures taken, the parts concerned must be mounted, positioned and/or guarded in such a way that any fragments will be contained, preventing hazardous situations. 
Both rigid and flexible pipes carrying fluids, particularly those under high pressure, must be able to withstand the foreseen internal and external stresses and must be firmly attached and/or protected to ensure that no risk is posed by a rupture. 
Where the material to be processed is fed to the tool automatically, the following conditions must be fulfilled to avoid risks to persons: 
- when the workpiece comes into contact with the tool, the latter must have attained its normal working condition, 
- when the tool starts and/or stops (intentionally or accidentally), the feed movement and the tool movement must be coordinated. 
1.3.3. Risks due to falling or ejected objects 
Precautions must be taken to prevent risks from falling or ejected objects. 
1.3.4. Risks due to surfaces, edges or angles 
Insofar as their purpose allows, accessible parts of the machinery must have no sharp edges, no sharp angles and no rough surfaces likely to cause injury. 
1.3.5. Risks related to combined machinery 
Where the machinery is intended to carry out several different operations with manual removal of the piece between each operation (combined machinery), it must be designed and constructed in such a way as to enable each element to be used separately without the other elements constituting a risk for exposed persons. 
For this purpose, it must be possible to start and stop separately any elements that are not protected. 
1.3.6. Risks related to variations in operating conditions 
Where the machinery performs operations under different conditions of use, it must be designed and constructed in such a way that selection and adjustment of these conditions can be carried out safely and reliably. 
1.3.7. Risks related to moving parts 
The moving parts of machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent risks of contact which could lead to accidents or must, where risks persist, be fitted with guards or protective devices. 
All necessary steps must be taken to prevent accidental blockage of moving parts involved in the work. In cases where, despite the precautions taken, a blockage is likely to occur, the necessary specific protective devices and tools must, when appropriate, be provided to enable the equipment to be safely unblocked. 
The instructions and, where possible, a sign on the machinery shall identify these specific protective devices and how they are to be used. 
1.3.8. Choice of protection against risks arising from moving parts 
Guards or protective devices designed to protect against risks arising from moving parts must be selected on the basis of the type of risk. The following guidelines must be used to help to make the choice. 
1.3.8.1. Moving transmission parts 
Guards designed to protect persons against the hazards generated by moving transmission parts must be: 
- either fixed guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.1, or 
- interlocking movable guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.2. 
Interlocking movable guards should be used where frequent access is envisaged. 
1.3.8.2. Moving parts involved in the process 
Guards or protective devices designed to protect persons against the hazards generated by moving parts involved in the process must be: 
- either fixed guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.1, or 
- interlocking movable guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.2, or 
- protective devices as referred to in section 1.4.3, or 
- a combination of the above. 
However, when certain moving parts directly involved in the process cannot be made completely inaccessible during operation owing to operations requiring operator intervention, such parts must be fitted with: 
- fixed guards or interlocking movable guards preventing access to those sections of the parts that are not used in the work, and 
- adjustable guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.3 restricting access to those sections of the moving parts where access is necessary.

Isolators must also be capable of being locked where an operator is unable, from any of the points to which he has access, to check that the energy is still cut off. 
In the case of machinery capable of being plugged into an electricity supply, removal of the plug is sufficient, provided that the operator can check from any of the points to which he has access that the plug remains removed. 
After the energy is cut off, it must be possible to dissipate normally any energy remaining or stored in the circuits of the machinery without risk to persons. 
As an exception to the requirement laid down in the previous paragraphs, certain circuits may remain connected to their energy sources in order, for example, to hold parts, to protect information, to light interiors, etc. In this case, special steps must be taken to ensure operator safety.

3. SUPPLEMENTARY ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO OFFSET HAZARDS DUE TO THE MOBILITY OF MACHINERY 
Machinery presenting hazards due to its mobility must meet all the essential health and safety requirements described in this chapter (see General Principles, point 4). 
3.1. GENERAL 
3.1.1. Definitions 
(a) %quot%Machinery presenting hazards due to its mobility%quot% means 
- machinery the operation of which requires either mobility while working, or continuous or semi-continuous movement between a succession of fixed working locations, or 
- machinery which is operated without being moved, but which may be equipped in such a way as to enable it to be moved more easily from one place to another. 
(b) %quot%Driver%quot% means an operator responsible for the movement of a machine. The driver may be transported by the machinery or may be on foot, accompanying the machinery, or may guide the machinery by remote control. 
3.2. WORK POSITIONS 
3.2.1. Driving position 
Visibility from the driving position must be such that the driver can, in complete safety for himself and the exposed persons, operate the machinery and its tools in their foreseeable conditions of use. Where necessary, appropriate devices must be provided to remedy hazards due to inadequate direct vision. 
Machinery on which the driver is transported must be designed and constructed in such a way that, from the driving positions, there is no risk to the driver from inadvertent contact with the wheels and tracks. 
The driving position of ride-on drivers must be designed and constructed in such a way that a driver's cab may be fitted, provided this does not increase the risk and there is room for it. The cab must incorporate a place for the instructions needed for the driver. 
3.2.2. Seating 
Where there is a risk that operators or other persons transported by the machinery may be crushed between parts of the machinery and the ground should the machinery roll or tip over, in particular for machinery equipped with a protective structure referred to in section 3.4.3 or 3.4.4, their seats must be designed or equipped with a restraint system so as to keep the persons in their seats, without restricting movements necessary for operations or movements relative to the structure caused by the suspension of the seats. Such restraint systems should not be fitted if they increase the risk. 
3.2.3. Positions for other persons 
If the conditions of use provide that persons other than the driver may occasionally or regularly be transported by the machinery or work on it, appropriate positions must be provided which enable them to be transported or to work on it without risk. 
The second and third paragraphs of section 3.2.1 also apply to the places provided for persons other than the driver. 
3.3. CONTROL SYSTEMS 
If necessary, steps must be taken to prevent unauthorised use of controls. 
In the case of remote controls, each control unit must clearly identify the machinery to be controlled from that unit. 
The remote control system must be designed and constructed in such a way as to affect only: 
- the machinery in question, 
- the functions in question. 
Remote controlled machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that it will respond only to signals from the intended control units. 
3.3.1. Control devices 
The driver must be able to actuate all control devices required to operate the machinery from the driving position, except for functions which can be safely actuated only by using control devices located elsewhere. These functions include, in particular, those for which operators other than the driver are responsible or for which the driver has to leave the driving position in order to control them safely. 
Where there are pedals, they must be so designed, constructed and fitted as to allow safe operation by the driver with the minimum risk of incorrect operation. They must have a slip-resistant surface and be easy to clean. 
Where their operation can lead to hazards, notably dangerous movements, the control devices, except for those with preset positions, must return to the neutral position as soon as they are released by the operator. 
In the case of wheeled machinery, the steering system must be designed and constructed in such a way as to reduce the force of sudden movements of the steering wheel or the steering lever caused by shocks to the guide wheels. 
Any control that locks the differential must be so designed and arranged that it allows the differential to be unlocked when the machinery is moving. 
The sixth paragraph of section 1.2.2, concerning acoustic and/or visual warning signals, applies only in the case of reversing. 
3.3.2. Starting/moving 
All travel movements of self-propelled machinery with a ride-on driver must be possible only if the driver is at the controls. 
Where, for operating purposes, machinery is fitted with devices which exceed its normal clearance zone (e.g. stabilisers, jib, etc.), the driver must be provided with the means of checking easily, before moving the machinery, that such devices are in a particular position which allows safe movement. 
This also applies to all other parts which, to allow safe movement, have to be in particular positions, locked if necessary. 
Where it does not give rise to other risks, movement of the machinery must depend on safe positioning of the aforementioned parts. 
It must not be possible for unintentional movement of the machinery to occur while the engine is being started. 
3.3.3. Travelling function 
Without prejudice to road traffic regulations, self-propelled machinery and its trailers must meet the requirements for slowing down, stopping, braking and immobilisation so as to ensure safety under all the operating, load, speed, ground and gradient conditions allowed for. 
The driver must be able to slow down and stop self-propelled machinery by means of a main device. Where safety so requires, in the event of a failure of the main device, or in the absence of the energy supply needed to actuate the main device, an emergency device with a fully independent and easily accessible control device must be provided for slowing down and stopping. 
Where safety so requires, a parking device must be provided to render stationary machinery immobile. This device may be combined with one of the devices referred to in the second paragraph, provided that it is purely mechanical. 
Remote-controlled machinery must be equipped with devices for stopping operation automatically and immediately and for preventing potentially dangerous operation in the following situations: 
- if the driver loses control, 
- if it receives a stop signal, 
- if a fault is detected in a safety-related part of the system, 
- if no validation signal is detected within a specified time. 
Section 1.2.4 does not apply to the travelling function. 
3.3.4. Movement of pedestrian-controlled machinery 
Movement of pedestrian-controlled self-propelled machinery must be possible only through sustained action on the relevant control device by the driver. In particular, it must not be possible for movement to occur while the engine is being started. 
The control systems for pedestrian-controlled machinery must be designed in such a way as to minimise the risks arising from inadvertent movement of the machine towards the driver, in particular: 
- crushing, 
- injury from rotating tools. 
The speed of travel of the machinery must be compatible with the pace of a driver on foot. 
In the case of machinery on which a rotary tool may be fitted, it must not be possible to actuate the tool when the reverse control is engaged, except where the movement of the machinery results from movement of the tool. In the latter case, the reversing speed must be such that it does not endanger the driver. 
3.3.5. Control circuit failure 
A failure in the power supply to the power-assisted steering, where fitted, must not prevent machinery from being steered during the time required to stop it. 
3.4. PROTECTION AGAINST MECHANICAL HAZARDS 
3.4.1. Uncontrolled movements 
Machinery must be designed, constructed and where appropriate placed on its mobile support in such a way as to ensure that, when moved, uncontrolled oscillations of its centre of gravity do not affect its stability or exert excessive strain on its structure. 
3.4.2. Moving transmission parts 
By way of exception to section 1.3.8.1, in the case of engines, moveable guards preventing access to the moving parts in the engine compartment need not have interlocking devices if they have to be opened either by the use of a tool or key or by a control located in the driving position, providing the latter is in a fully enclosed cab with a lock to prevent unauthorised access. 
3.4.3. Roll-over and tip-over 
Where, in the case of self-propelled machinery with a ride-on driver, operator(s) or other person(s), there is a risk of rolling or tipping over, the machinery must be fitted with an appropriate protective structure, unless this increases the risk. 
This structure must be such that in the event of rolling or tipping over it affords the ride-on person(s) an adequate deflection-limiting volume. 
In order to verify that the structure complies with the requirement laid down in the second paragraph, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must, for each type of structure concerned, perform appropriate tests or have such tests performed. 
3.4.4. Falling objects 
Where, in the case of self-propelled machinery with a ride-on driver, operator(s) or other person(s), there is a risk due to falling objects or material, the machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to take account of this risk and fitted, if its size allows, with an appropriate protective structure. 
This structure must be such that, in the event of falling objects or material, it guarantees the ride-on person(s) an adequate deflection-limiting volume. 
In order to verify that the structure complies with the requirement laid down in the second paragraph, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must, for each type of structure concerned, perform appropriate tests or have such tests performed. 
3.4.5. Means of access 
Handholds and steps must be designed, constructed and arranged in such a way that the operators use them instinctively and do not use the control devices to assist access. 
3.4.6. Towing devices 
All machinery used to tow or to be towed must be fitted with towing or coupling devices designed, constructed and arranged in such a way as to ensure easy and secure connection and disconnection and to prevent accidental disconnection during use. 
Insofar as the tow bar load so requires, such machinery must be equipped with a support with a bearing surface suited to the load and the ground. 
3.4.7. Transmission of power between self-propelled machinery (or tractor) and recipient machinery 
Removable mechanical transmission devices linking self-propelled machinery (or a tractor) to the first fixed bearing of recipient machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that any part that moves during operation is protected over its whole length. 
On the side of the self-propelled machinery (or tractor), the power take-off to which the removable mechanical transmission device is attached must be protected either by a guard fixed and linked to the self-propelled machinery (or tractor) or by any other device offering equivalent protection. 
It must be possible to open this guard for access to the removable transmission device. Once it is in place, there must be enough room to prevent the drive shaft damaging the guard when the machinery (or the tractor) is moving. 
On the recipient machinery side, the input shaft must be enclosed in a protective casing fixed to the machinery. 
Torque limiters or freewheels may be fitted to universal joint transmissions only on the side adjoining the driven machinery. The removable mechanical transmission device must be marked accordingly. 
All recipient machinery, the operation of which requires a removable mechanical transmission device to connect it to self-propelled machinery (or a tractor), must have a system for attaching the removable mechanical transmission device so that, when the machinery is uncoupled, the removable mechanical transmission device and its guard are not damaged by contact with the ground or part of the machinery. 
The outside parts of the guard must be so designed, constructed and arranged that they cannot turn with the removable mechanical transmission device. The guard must cover the transmission to the ends of the inner jaws in the case of simple universal joints and at least to the centre of the outer joint or joints in the case of wide-angle universal joints. 
If means of access to working positions are provided near to the removable mechanical transmission device, they must be designed and constructed in such a way that the shaft guards cannot be used as steps, unless designed and constructed for that purpose. 
3.5. PROTECTION AGAINST OTHER HAZARDS 
3.5.1. Batteries 
The battery housing must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent the electrolyte being ejected on to the operator in the event of rollover or tipover and to avoid the accumulation of vapours in places occupied by operators. 
Machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that the battery can be disconnected with the aid of an easily accessible device provided for that purpose. 
3.5.2. Fire 
Depending on the hazards anticipated by the manufacturer, machinery must, where its size permits: 
- either allow easily accessible fire extinguishers to be fitted, or 
- be provided with built-in extinguisher systems. 
3.5.3. Emissions of hazardous substances 
The second and third paragraphs of section 1.5.13 do not apply where the main function of the machinery is the spraying of products. However, the operator must be protected against the risk of exposure to such hazardous emissions. 
3.6. INFORMATION AND INDICATIONS 
3.6.1. Signs, signals and warnings 
All machinery must have signs and/or instruction plates concerning use, adjustment and maintenance, wherever necessary, so as to ensure the health and safety of persons. They must be chosen, designed and constructed in such a way as to be clearly visible and indelible. 
Without prejudice to the provisions of road traffic regulations, machinery with a ride-on driver must have the following equipment: 
- an acoustic warning device to alert persons, 
- a system of light signals relevant to the intended conditions of use; the latter requirement does not apply to machinery intended solely for underground working and having no electrical power, 
- where necessary, there must be an appropriate connection between a trailer and the machinery for the operation of signals. 
Remote-controlled machinery which, under normal conditions of use, exposes persons to the risk of impact or crushing must be fitted with appropriate means to signal its movements or with means to protect persons against such risks. The same applies to machinery which involves, when in use, the constant repetition of a forward and backward movement on a single axis where the area to the rear of the machine is not directly visible to the driver. 
Machinery must be constructed in such a way that the warning and signalling devices cannot be disabled unintentionally. Where it is essential for safety, such devices must be provided with the means to check that they are in good working order and their failure must be made apparent to the operator. 
Where the movement of machinery or its tools is particularly hazardous, signs on the machinery must be provided to warn against approaching the machinery while it is working; the signs must be legible at a sufficient distance to ensure the safety of persons who have to be in the vicinity. 
3.6.2. Marking 
The following must be shown legibly and indelibly on all machinery: 
- nominal power expressed in kilowatts (kW), 
- mass of the most usual configuration, in kilograms (kg); 
and, where appropriate: 
- maximum drawbar pull provided for at the coupling hook, in Newtons (N), 
- maximum vertical load provided for on the coupling hook, in Newtons (N). 
3.6.3. Instructions 
3.6.3.1. Vibrations 
The instructions must give the following information concerning vibrations transmitted by the machinery to the hand-arm system or to the whole body: 
- the vibration total value to which the hand-arm system is subjected, if it exceeds 2,5 m/s2. Where this value does not exceed 2,5 m/s2, this must be mentioned, 
- the highest root mean square value of weighted acceleration to which the whole body is subjected, if it exceeds 0,5 m/s2. Where this value does not exceed 0,5 m/s2, this must be mentioned, 
- the uncertainty of measurement. 
These values must be either those actually measured for the machinery in question or those established on the basis of measurements taken for technically comparable machinery which is representative of the machinery to be produced. 
Where harmonised standards are not applied, the vibration must be measured using the most appropriate measurement code for the machinery concerned. 
The operating conditions during measurement and the measurement codes used must be described. 
3.6.3.2. Multiple uses 
The instructions for machinery allowing several uses depending on the equipment used and the instructions for the interchangeable equipment must contain the information necessary for safe assembly and use of the basic machinery and the interchangeable equipment that can be fitted. 
4. SUPPLEMENTARY ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO OFFSET HAZARDS DUE TO LIFTING OPERATIONS 
Machinery presenting hazards due to lifting operations must meet all the relevant essential health and safety requirements described in this chapter (see General Principles, point 4). 
4.1. GENERAL 
4.1.1. Definitions 
(a) %quot%Lifting operation%quot% means a movement of unit loads consisting of goods and/or persons necessitating, at a given moment, a change of level. 
(b) %quot%Guided load%quot% means a load where the total movement is made along rigid or flexible guides whose position is determined by fixed points. 
(c) %quot%Working coefficient%quot% means the arithmetic ratio between the load guaranteed by the manufacturer or his authorised representative up to which a component is able to hold it and the maximum working load marked on the component. 
(d) %quot%Test coefficient%quot% means the arithmetic ratio between the load used to carry out the static or dynamic tests on lifting machinery or a lifting accessory and the maximum working load marked on the lifting machinery or lifting accessory. 
(e) %quot%Static test%quot% means the test during which lifting machinery or a lifting accessory is first inspected and subjected to a force corresponding to the maximum working load multiplied by the appropriate static test coefficient and then re-inspected once the said load has been released to ensure that no damage has occurred. 
(f) %quot%Dynamic test%quot% means the test during which lifting machinery is operated in all its possible configurations at the maximum working load multiplied by the appropriate dynamic test coefficient with account being taken of the dynamic behaviour of the lifting machinery in order to check that it functions properly. 
(g) %quot%Carrier%quot% means a part of the machinery on or in which persons and/or goods are supported in order to be lifted. 
4.1.2. Protection against mechanical hazards 
4.1.2.1. Risks due to lack of stability 
Machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that the stability required by section 1.3.1 is maintained both in service and out of service, including all stages of transportation, assembly and dismantling, during foreseeable component failures and also during the tests carried out in accordance with the instruction handbook. To that end, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must use the appropriate verification methods. 
4.1.2.2. Machinery running on guide rails and rail tracks 
Machinery must be provided with devices which act on the guide rails or tracks to prevent derailment. 
If, despite such devices, there remains a risk of derailment or of failure of a rail or of a running component, devices must be provided which prevent the equipment, component or load from falling or the machinery from overturning. 
4.1.2.3. Mechanical strength 
Machinery, lifting accessories and their components must be capable of withstanding the stresses to which they are subjected, both in and, where applicable, out of use, under the installation and operating conditions provided for and in all relevant configurations, with due regard, where appropriate, to the effects of atmospheric factors and forces exerted by persons. This requirement must also be satisfied during transport, assembly and dismantling. 
Machinery and lifting accessories must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent failure from fatigue and wear, taking due account of their intended use. 
The materials used must be chosen on the basis of the intended working environments, with particular regard to corrosion, abrasion, impacts, extreme temperatures, fatigue, brittleness and ageing. 
Machinery and lifting accessories must be designed and constructed in such a way as to withstand the overload in the static tests without permanent deformation or patent defect. Strength calculations must take account of the value of the static test coefficient chosen to guarantee an adequate level of safety. That coefficient has, as a general rule, the following values: 
(a) manually-operated machinery and lifting accessories: 1,5; 
(b) other machinery: 1,25. 
Machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to undergo, without failure, the dynamic tests carried out using the maximum working load multiplied by the dynamic test coefficient. This dynamic test coefficient is chosen so as to guarantee an adequate level of safety: the coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 1,1. As a general rule, the tests will be performed at the nominal speeds provided for. Should the control circuit of the machinery allow for a number of simultaneous movements, the tests must be carried out under the least favourable conditions, as a general rule by combining the movements concerned. 
4.1.2.4. Pulleys, drums, wheels, ropes and chains 
Pulleys, drums and wheels must have a diameter commensurate with the size of the ropes or chains with which they can be fitted. 
Drums and wheels must be designed, constructed and installed in such a way that the ropes or chains with which they are equipped can be wound without coming off. 
Ropes used directly for lifting or supporting the load must not include any splicing other than at their ends. Splicings are, however, tolerated in installations which are intended by design to be modified regularly according to needs of use. 
Complete ropes and their endings must have a working coefficient chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety. As a general rule, this coefficient is equal to 5. 
Lifting chains must have a working coefficient chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety. As a general rule, this coefficient is equal to 4. 
In order to verify that an adequate working coefficient has been attained, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must, for each type of chain and rope used directly for lifting the load and for the rope ends, perform the appropriate tests or have such tests performed. 
4.1.2.5. Lifting accessories and their components 
Lifting accessories and their components must be sized with due regard to fatigue and ageing processes for a number of operating cycles consistent with their expected life-span as specified in the operating conditions for a given application. 
Moreover: 
(a) the working coefficient of wire-rope/rope-end combinations must be chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; this coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 5. Ropes must not comprise any splices or loops other than at their ends; 
(b) where chains with welded links are used, they must be of the short-link type. The working coefficient of chains must be chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; this coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 4; 
(c) the working coefficient for textile ropes or slings is dependent on the material, method of manufacture, dimensions and use. This coefficient must be chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; it is, as a general rule, equal to 7, provided the materials used are shown to be of very good quality and the method of manufacture is appropriate to the intended use. Should this not be the case, the coefficient is, as a general rule, set at a higher level in order to secure an equivalent level of safety. Textile ropes and slings must not include any knots, connections or splicing other than at the ends of the sling, except in the case of an endless sling; 
(d) all metallic components making up, or used with, a sling must have a working coefficient chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; this coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 4; 
(e) the maximum working load of a multilegged sling is determined on the basis of the working coefficient of the weakest leg, the number of legs and a reduction factor which depends on the slinging configuration; 
(f) in order to verify that an adequate working coefficient has been attained, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must, for each type of component referred to in (a), (b), (c) and (d), perform the appropriate tests or have such tests performed. 
4.1.2.6. Control of movements 
Devices for controlling movements must act in such a way that the machinery on which they are installed is kept safe. 
(a) Machinery must be designed and constructed or fitted with devices in such a way that the amplitude of movement of its components is kept within the specified limits. The operation of such devices must, where appropriate, be preceded by a warning. 
(b) Where several fixed or rail-mounted machines can be manoeuvred simultaneously in the same place, with risks of collision, such machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to make it possible to fit systems enabling these risks to be avoided. 
(c) Machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that the loads cannot creep dangerously or fall freely and unexpectedly, even in the event of partial or total failure of the power supply or when the operator stops operating the machine. 
(d) It must not be possible, under normal operating conditions, to lower the load solely by friction brake, except in the case of machinery whose function requires it to operate in that way. 
(e) Holding devices must be designed and constructed in such a way that inadvertent dropping of the loads is avoided. 
4.1.2.7. Movements of loads during handling 
The operating position of machinery must be located in such a way as to ensure the widest possible view of trajectories of the moving parts, in order to avoid possible collisions with persons, equipment or other machinery which might be manoeuvring at the same time and liable to constitute a hazard. 
Machinery with guided loads must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent persons from being injured by movement of the load, the carrier or the counterweights, if any. 
4.1.2.8. Machinery serving fixed landings 
4.1.2.8.1. Movements of the carrier 
The movement of the carrier of machinery serving fixed landings must be rigidly guided to and at the landings. Scissor systems are also regarded as rigid guidance. 
4.1.2.8.2. Access to the carrier 
Where persons have access to the carrier, the machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure that the carrier remains stationary during access, in particular while it is being loaded or unloaded. 
The machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure that the difference in level between the carrier and the landing being served does not create a risk of tripping. 
4.1.2.8.3. Risks due to contact with the moving carrier 
Where necessary in order to fulfil the requirement expressed in the second paragraph of section 4.1.2.7, the travel zone must be rendered inaccessible during normal operation. 
When, during inspection or maintenance, there is a risk that persons situated under or above the carrier may be crushed between the carrier and any fixed parts, sufficient free space must be provided either by means of physical refuges or by means of mechanical devices blocking the movement of the carrier. 
4.1.2.8.4. Risk due to the load falling off the carrier 
Where there is a risk due to the load falling off the carrier, the machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent this risk. 
4.1.2.8.5. Landings 
Risks due to contact of persons at landings with the moving carrier or other moving parts must be prevented. 
Where there is a risk due to persons falling into the travel zone when the carrier is not present at the landings, guards must be fitted in order to prevent this risk. Such guards must not open in the direction of the travel zone. They must be fitted with an interlocking device controlled by the position of the carrier that prevents: 
- hazardous movements of the carrier until the guards are closed and locked, 
- hazardous opening of a guard until the carrier has stopped at the corresponding landing. 
4.1.3. Fitness for purpose 
When lifting machinery or lifting accessories are placed on the market or are first put into service, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must ensure, by taking appropriate measures or having them taken, that the machinery or the lifting accessories which are ready for use — whether manually or power-operated — can fulfil their specified functions safely. 
The static and dynamic tests referred to in section 4.1.2.3 must be performed on all lifting machinery ready to be put into service. 
Where the machinery cannot be assembled in the manufacturer's premises or in the premises of his authorised representative, the appropriate measures must be taken at the place of use. Otherwise, the measures may be taken either in the manufacturer's premises or at the place of use. 
4.2. REQUIREMENTS FOR MACHINERY WHOSE POWER SOURCE IS OTHER THAN MANUAL EFFORT 
4.2.1. Control of movements 
Hold-to-run control devices must be used to control the movements of the machinery or its equipment. However, for partial or complete movements in which there is no risk of the load or the machinery colliding, the said devices may be replaced by control devices authorising automatic stops at pre-selected positions without the operator holding a hold-to-run control device. 
4.2.2. Loading control 
Machinery with a maximum working load of not less than 1000 kilograms or an overturning moment of not less than 40000 Nm must be fitted with devices to warn the driver and prevent dangerous movements in the event: 
- of overloading, either as a result of the maximum working load or the maximum working moment due to the load being exceeded, or 
- of the overturning moment being exceeded. 
4.2.3. Installations guided by ropes 
Rope carriers, tractors or tractor carriers must be held by counterweights or by a device allowing permanent control of the tension. 
4.3. INFORMATION AND MARKINGS 
4.3.1. Chains, ropes and webbing 
Each length of lifting chain, rope or webbing not forming part of an assembly must bear a mark or, where this is not possible, a plate or irremovable ring bearing the name and address of the manufacturer or his authorised representative and the identifying reference of the relevant certificate. 
The certificate mentioned above must show at least the following information:

5.6. EXHAUST EMISSIONS 
Exhaust emissions from internal combustion engines must not be discharged upwards. 
6. SUPPLEMENTARY ESSENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR MACHINERY PRESENTING PARTICULAR HAZARDS DUE TO THE LIFTING OF PERSONS 
Machinery presenting hazards due to the lifting of persons must meet all the relevant essential health and safety requirements described in this chapter (see General Principles, point 4). 
6.1. GENERAL 
6.1.1. Mechanical strength 
The carrier, including any trapdoors, must be designed and constructed in such a way as to offer the space and strength corresponding to the maximum number of persons permitted on the carrier and the maximum working load. 
The working coefficients for components set out in sections 4.1.2.4 and 4.1.2.5 are inadequate for machinery intended for the lifting of persons and must, as a general rule, be doubled. Machinery intended for lifting persons or persons and goods must be fitted with a suspension or supporting system for the carrier designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure an adequate overall level of safety and to prevent the risk of the carrier falling. 
If ropes or chains are used to suspend the carrier, as a general rule, at least two independent ropes or chains are required, each with its own anchorage. 
6.1.2. Loading control for machinery moved by power other than human strength 
The requirements of section 4.2.2 apply regardless of the maximum working load and overturning moment, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that there is no risk of overloading or overturning. 
6.2. CONTROL DEVICES 
Where safety requirements do not impose other solutions, the carrier must, as a general rule, be designed and constructed in such a way that persons in the carrier have means of controlling upward and downward movements and, if appropriate, other movements of the carrier. 
In operation, those control devices must override any other devices controlling the same movement with the exception of emergency stop devices. 
The control devices for these movements must be of the hold-to-run type except where the carrier itself is completely enclosed. 
6.3. RISKS TO PERSONS IN OR ON THE CARRIER 
6.3.1. Risks due to movements of the carrier 
Machinery for lifting persons must be designed, constructed or equipped in such a way that the acceleration or deceleration of the carrier does not engender risks for persons. 
6.3.2. Risk of persons falling from the carrier 
The carrier must not tilt to an extent which creates a risk of the occupants falling, including when the machinery and carrier are moving. 
Where the carrier is designed as a work station, provision must be made to ensure stability and to prevent hazardous movements. 
If the measures referred to in section 1.5.15 are not adequate, carriers must be fitted with a sufficient number of suitable anchorage points for the number of persons permitted on the carrier. The anchorage points must be strong enough for the use of personal protective equipment against falls from a height. 
Any trapdoor in floors or ceilings or side doors must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent inadvertent opening and must open in a direction that obviates any risk of falling, should they open unexpectedly. 
6.3.3. Risk due to objects falling on the carrier 
Where there is a risk of objects falling on the carrier and endangering persons, the carrier must be equipped with a protective roof. 
6.4. MACHINERY SERVING FIXED LANDINGS 
6.4.1. Risks to persons in or on the carrier 
The carrier must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent risks due to contact between persons and/or objects in or on the carrier with any fixed or moving elements. Where necessary in order to fulfil this requirement, the carrier itself must be completely enclosed with doors fitted with an interlocking device that prevents hazardous movements of the carrier unless the doors are closed. The doors must remain closed if the carrier stops between landings where there is a risk of falling from the carrier. 
The machinery must be designed, constructed and, where necessary, equipped with devices in such a way as to prevent uncontrolled upward or downward movement of the carrier. These devices must be able to stop the carrier at its maximum working load and at the foreseeable maximum speed. 
The stopping action must not cause deceleration harmful to the occupants, whatever the load conditions. 
6.4.2. Controls at landings 
Controls, other than those for emergency use, at landings must not initiate movements of the carrier when: 
- the control devices in the carrier are being operated, 
- the carrier is not at a landing. 
6.4.3. Access to the carrier 
The guards at the landings and on the carrier must be designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure safe transfer to and from the carrier, taking into consideration the foreseeable range of goods and persons to be lifted. 
6.5. MARKINGS 
The carrier must bear the information necessary to ensure safety including: 
- the number of persons permitted on the carrier, 
- the maximum working load.
