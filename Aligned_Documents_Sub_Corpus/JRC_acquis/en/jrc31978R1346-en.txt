COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1346/78 of 19 June 1978 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 on the common organization of the market in seeds 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organization of the market in seeds (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1167/77 (4), provided for the granting, under certain conditions, of a. production aid for seeds ; whereas the granting of this aid is decided each year for the marketing year beginning in the following year; 
Whereas the production of most seed varieties is of a multiannual nature ; whereas in order to improve the planning of production the aid as fixed hitherto should be replaced by an aid fixed for two consecutive marketing years; 
Whereas it is necessary to have adequate information on the situation and the development prospects for the market in the. Community ; whereas, therefore, with regard to seeds produced in the Community, the system in force in the Community makes it possible to gather the necessary information since it stipulates that only certified seeds produced in duly authorized establishments or under duly registered contracts can be marketed ; whereas, in addition, to a large extent the Community is supplied by means of multiplication contracts concluded with seed producers in non-member countries ; whereas, therefore, registration of these contracts should be required for species which play an important part in supplies to the market in the Community ; whereas, moreover, this information should be covered by the obligation of statistical secrecy in order to assure the interested parties that it will not be used for other purposes, thus enabling perfectly objective information to be obtained,
