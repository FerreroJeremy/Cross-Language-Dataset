COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3594/91 of 11 December 1991 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products subject to reference quantities and originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 715/90 of 5 March 1990 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 523/91 (2), and in particular Articles 16 and 27 thereof, 
Whereas Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 715/90 stipulates for certain agricultural products, covered by that Regulation and originating in those countries, the progressive reduction, subject to reference quantities and a community surveillance in a set timetable of the customs duties; 
Whereas, these duty reductions shall be phased in over the same periods and in accordance with the same timetable as those laid down in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal for the same products imported from these countries into the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985; 
Whereas, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3593/91 of 11 December 1991 abolishing in two stages certain customs duties applicable in trade between the Community of Ten and Spain and Portugal as a result of the Mediterranean agreements (3) foresees that the residual customs duties applicable to products from Spain and Portugal for which the dismantling of tariffs continues after 1 January 1993 will be eliminated in two equal instalments on 1 January 1992 and 1 January 1993; 
Whereas the same concession should be granted for the same products originating in ACP-States; 
Whereas by virtue of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1820/87 of 25 June 1987 concerning the application of Decision No 2/87 of the ACP/EEC Council of Ministers on the advance implementation of the Protocol to the Third ACP-EEC Convention (4) consequent on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities, the said reference quantities shall be applied in Spain and Portugal; 
Whereas, in order to enable the competent authorities within the Commission to establish an annual trade balance sheet for each of the products and, if necessary, to put into application the arrangement provided for in Article 16 (3) of the abovementioned Regulation (EEC) No 715/90, these products are subject to a statistical surveillance in accordance with Council Regulations (EEC) No 2658/87 (5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3537/91 (6), and (EEC) No 1736/75 (7); 
Whereas imports of the products in question are charged against the reference quantities at Community level within pre-established timetables, as and when the products are entered with the customs authorities for free circulation; whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to establish reference quantities for those products listed in the Annex; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. Imports into the Community of certain products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States shall be subject to reference quantities and to a statistical surveillance.

2. Quantities shall be charged against the reference quantities as and when products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation and accompanied by a movement certificate. If the movement certificate is submitted a posteriori, the goods shall be charged against the corresponding reference quantity at the moment when the goods are entered for free circulation. 
The extent to which the reference quantities are used up shall be determined at Community level on the basis of the imports charged against them in the manner defined in the first subparagraph, as communicated to the Statistical Office of the European Communities in application of Regulations (EEC) No 2658/87 and (EEC) No 1736/75. 
Article 2 
The Member States and the Commission shall cooperate closely to ensure that this Regulation is complied with.
