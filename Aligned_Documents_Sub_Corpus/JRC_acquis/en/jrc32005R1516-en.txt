Commission Regulation (EC) No 1516/2005 
of 19 September 2005 
opening a standing invitation to tender for the export of barley held by the Austrian intervention agency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 [2] lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 [3] lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention. 
(3) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 30530 tonnes of barley held by the Austrian intervention agency. 
(4) Special procedures must be laid down to ensure that the operations and their monitoring are properly effected. To that end, securities should be lodged to ensure that the goals of the operations are achieved without excessive cost to the operators. Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
(5) To forestall reimportation, exports under this invitation to tender should be limited to certain third countries. 
(6) Article 7(2a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 allows the successful exporting tenderer to be reimbursed the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the actual place of exit, up to a certain ceiling. In view of Austria’s geographical location, this provision should be applied. 
(7) With a view to modernising the management of the system, provision should be made for the electronic transmission of the information required by the Commission. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,

Article 6 
The intervention agency, the storer and the successful tenderer shall, at the request of the latter and by common agreement, either before or at the time of removal from storage as the tenderer chooses, take reference samples for counter-analysis at the rate of at least one sample for every 500 tonnes and shall analyse the samples. The intervention agency may be represented by a proxy, provided this is not the storer. 
Reference samples for counter-analysis shall be taken and analysed within seven working days of the date of the successful tenderer’s request or within three working days if the samples are taken on removal from storage. 
In the event of a dispute, the analysis results shall be forwarded electronically to the Commission. 
Article 7 
1. The successful tenderer must accept the lot as established if the final result of the sample analyses indicates a quality: 
(a) higher than that specified in the notice of invitation to tender; 
(b) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, providing that the differences having regard to those criteria do not exceed the following limits: 
- one kilogram per hectolitre as regards specific weight, which must not, however, be less than 64 kg/hl,

(a) accept the lot as established, or

The successful tenderer shall immediately inform the Commission thereof using the form in Annex I. 
If, following successive replacements, the successful tenderer has not received a replacement lot of the quality laid down within one month of the date of the request for a replacement, the successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations and the securities shall be released, provided the Commission and the intervention agency have been immediately informed using the form in Annex I. 
Article 9 
1. If the barley is removed before the results of the analyses provided for in Article 6 are known, all risks shall be borne by the successful tenderer from the time the lot is removed, without prejudice to any means of redress the tenderer might have against the storer.
