of 18 July 2006 
fixing the aid for dried fodder for the 2005/06 marketing year 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003 lays down the amount of the aid for dried fodder to be paid to processors for up to the maximum guaranteed quantity established in Article 5(1) of that Regulation. 
(2) The quantities notified to the Commission by the Member States for the 2005/06 marketing year under the second subparagraph of Article 33(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2005 of 7 March 2005 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1786/2003 on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder [2] include quantities in stock on 31 March 2006 for which, under Article 34a of that Regulation, aid may be paid for the 2005/06 marketing year.
