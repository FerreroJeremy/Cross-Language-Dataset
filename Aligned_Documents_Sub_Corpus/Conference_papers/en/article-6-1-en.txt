This method, which is based on the dynamic hard clustering algorithm for relational data, is designed to provided a partition and a prototype for each cluster as well as to learn a relevance weight for each dissimilarity matrix by optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fit between clusters and their representatives. These relevance weights change at each algorithm iteration and are different from one cluster to another.
