Links Creation and Deletion We want to add semantics links to the acception base in order to assess the integrity of the base. Agents which can evaluate a given semantic relation can create valued semantics links if the valuation result is above a threshold th. For exemple, if one antonymy agent evaluates antonymy between ,cold- and ,hot- at a value above th, it builds a semantic link between the two acceptions valued at th. This threshold is not fixed in advance, and it evolves according to the number of links already built.
