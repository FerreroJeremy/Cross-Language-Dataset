Specific features. Due to their different use, each model integrates some specific features. In order to deal with unknown words and special tokens, we incorporate standard tagging features in the CRF: lowercase forms of the words, word prefixes of length 1 to 4, word suffice of length 1 to 4, whether the word is capitalized, whether the token has a digit, whether it is an hyphen. We also add label bigrams. The reranker models integrate features associated with each MWE node, the value of which is the compound itself.
