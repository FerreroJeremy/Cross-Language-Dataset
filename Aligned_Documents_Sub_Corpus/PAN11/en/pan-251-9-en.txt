 Who doubt,
however, that fortune is the most powerful element of value?

Faust, Marguerite and Mephistopheles, and Werther and Charlotte, in German literature, and
only D. Quixote, Sancho, Dulcinea and D. Juan Tenorio, in Spanish, are the characters for notoriety,
fame, glory and splendor can be compared to the characters of Shakspeare,
in other European literatures.

But it depends on that in the dramas of Lope, Tirso, Calderon, Moreto, Alarcón y Rojas, that
throughout our great Spanish drama no more characters D. John, with much encouragement of life,
so predestination for immortality, like the heroes shakspearianos?

The I really do not exist in our great Spanish drama other characters who live like those. Was
decline of our poets or fortune?

Shakspeare wrote for a people who began to be large, which would extend his empire, to improve
their own civilization castiza and to disseminate and enforce it for all regions the world.
As he wrote to the people, wrote inspired and full of thoughts and feelings Village, and his
mind and his works are swollen with the future; contain in germ all the spirit of England
in the day. Our dramatic wrote also for the people inspired and filled
with people's feelings, but of a people who died, of a people castiza
and whose civilization itself would disappear, and whose spirit then
there was no be the spirit of today
