wit. Neither Voltaire nor Moratin denied.

The glory of the poet began when he lived and wrote his plays. After it has not been eclipsed
and never has been and will grow increasingly with the passage of time. But the greatness of
mountains were not seen or measured closely. Although little is known about the life of Shakspeare,
it seems likely knew him and tried many eminent men of the brilliant period in which Raleigh lived,
Bacon, the Earl of Essex, Milton, Hales, Kepler, Bellarmine, Alberico Gentile, Paolo Sarpi,
Vieta and a thousand others who knew him. None despised his talent did not consider it any
the merit of his plays, but no one paid him no worship, worship that now pays the most famous,
educated, intelligent and blessed the human race. Until was the nineteenth century, his most
fervent admirers exclaim, until he reached this age, whose Hamlet genius is living, readers could
not have understood the tragedy of Hamlet. Now literature, philosophy and thinking everything
is Shakspeare.

Your mind is the horizon beyond which we see nothing, nothing found, while we strive forward
by descry what is to come.
Singular Shakspeare would be so adored being among strangers, it
was less among themselves, among the English, who are so patriotic.
In England has had the great dramatic many biographers, critics, commentators,
