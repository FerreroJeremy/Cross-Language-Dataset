 It is good to gain heaven,
Beat other way but not to the forgiveness of those who insult you. God is so merciful that opens
a thousand ways to reach it. Then, get another and do not follow the meekness. Should be respected
and feared. Should they know who you are. What I counsel is to be very careful with what you
do, because if you punish Dona Ines without caution justice as you would paper a penny of spices,
and even you may be jailed or send to prison.

- Do not pretend to be scared
