 

My distinguished friend, for the Liberal, next Sunday, you asked me to write about things from the
time I spent in the island of Crete. Great is my desire to please you, but there are two difficulties.
As disclosed by mythologists and historians, what can I say that I have any news, other than a statement
of what they said, and is not in any dictionary, or rather encyclopedia?
