Sun and his face lit up, not knowing what to say, and Lucia is the
color off, looking in vain for the forces that move one side and open
lips into a smile. - But this should not be so, no. The director
put his arm at Sol de Lucia, accompanied by glances and jealous and
took refuge for a few moments with them on a balcony railing of granite,
which was hidden under a twisted vine of roses bloom.

Balcony was great and solemn night, very late, and the sky, loving
and talkative, as it is in our country where the air is clear, and
it seems that they talk and visits are the stars. - And above all,
Lucia y Sol, give you a kiss. - Look, Lucia - said his hands clasping
those of girls and talk as if the sun is not with them, who felt his
cheeks burning, and tightness in the chest with what the teacher said,
therefore that for a moment the sky was black, as well as his house
was calling Ms. Andrea -.

know how life goes on in Sun Valley, everyone knows. His father is dead.
His mother is in abject poverty. Yo, I love her like a daughter,
I tried to educate people to be saved from danger of being nice to
be so poor.

Lucia felt at that moment as the Sol's hands trembled, and made a motion
to withdraw and stand up. - Lady .... - No, no, Lucy.
