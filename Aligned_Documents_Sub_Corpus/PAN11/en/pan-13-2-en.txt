 Fresh air circulates freely, the sun lights up every room the water is pure
and healthy, especially furniture and beds boast exquisite cleanliness: the innocent have
vigilantes who care as nurses and teachers who seek to do into a ray of intellectual light in
those hard soft spots. Sometimes you do that, and the geek gradually be born to a higher life.
But more important than working on guard against evil to repair the existing. Infested huts,
sometimes so picturesque in landscape, must disappear for the comfortable and healthy homes replaced.
Should air enter freely and light in all human habitations. It should be noted everywhere good
hygiene for the body, united to perfect moral dignity. Thus acquire the mountain in several
generations a complete immunity from all these diseases that are now degraded to such a large number.
Then his people will be worthy of their surroundings, may provide satisfactorily covered mountains
and as the Greeks say, "These are our ancestors, and we like them. "

# The worship of mountains #

The worship of mountains between us there is still more alive than believe it. Many Sometimes
a villager, the discovery of the head, I noted the sun with your finger and told me solemnly:
"He is our God." And I also (I hardly dare say), more than one Once, looking at the August peaks
that dominate valleys and plains, I felt ready to classify them candidly
divine.

I would one day pass peacefully by a slope, obstructed by loose stones. Encallejonábase there
the wind and I was the face, bringing me with every breath a mist of rain and snow melted. Ashen
veil hiding the rocks and I could only make out vague masses at intervals black and threatening,
according to the thickness of the fog came up and away alternately. Found myself transfixed with
cold, sad, moody. Suddenly he made me look up clarity reflected by numerous drops. He had torn
the water cloud and snow over my head. The blue sky appeared to me bright and protruding up above
the serene summit of the mountain. The snow, embroidered on the edges of rocks as with delicate
arabesques, Argentina glowed with sun glare and fringed with gold trim. Were pure contours
of the top and clean as the statue drew a light in the shade but pride pyramid seemed to be
completely off the ground. Quiet strong, steadfast in his rest, seemed to float in the sky.
Belonged to another world and not to this planet shrouded in clouds and mists and in sordid rags.
At that appearance, I thought I see more than the abode of bliss, more than the Olympus, home
of the immortals. But a malicious tag closed again out where I had seen the mountain. I found
myself again from wind, snow and rain and consoléme to say, a God appeared to me!

At the origin of historic times, all peoples, simple children of a thousand heads, and looked toward the
mountains, saw them to the gods, or at least their thrones appearing and alternately hiding
under the veil of changing the veil. In those mountains saw almost all the origin of his race lived
there felt that their traditions and legends; there waiting for the future realization of their
ambitions and their dreams, hence assumed that El Salvador had to go down, the angel of glory or
of freedom. So important was the role high peaks in the life of nations, which could tell the story
of humanity the cult of the mountains. These are major milestones and stages positioned away
distance in the way of the people.

In the valleys of the great mountains of central Asia scholars say that was where those our ancestors,
to whom we owe the European languages ??came to be established at a time tribes first learned,
in the southern base of the highest mountains in the world is where Indians live, those to whom their
ancient Aryan civilization provides a kind of right of primogeniture. Their songs of other times not
say with what feeling of worship celebrated the "eighty-four thousand mountains of gold" that are
bathed in light rise over forests and plains. For many, the enormous mountains of the Himalayas,
snow-capped summit of major rivers of ice, are the gods themselves in full possession of his strength
and his majesty. The Gaurisankar, whose apex pierces the sky, and the Chamalari, less high
but more massive, apparently, by their isolation, are doubly worshiped as the Great Goddess
linked to the Great God. Those are the bed of ice crystal and diamond; those clouds of purple and
gold are sacred veil around them. Above him is the god Siva, who destroys and creates: there
too the goddess Chama, the Gauri, who conceived and stop. It down the rivers, plants, animals
and men.

In that prodigious jungle epics and Hindustani traditions, others have sprouted legends relating to
the Himalayan mountains and the show we all live with life sublime, and as goddesses, and
as mothers of continents and peoples. Such is the poetic legend that describes the earth as
a great lotus flower whose petals are extended penúnculas on the ocean and whose stamens and
pistils are the mountains of Meru, generating all life. The glaciers, streams and rivers that
descend from the heights to lead the the beneficial land floods, are also living beings, gods
and goddesses side put to the lowly mortals of the plains in indirect relationship with the supreme
divinities They prevail over the clouds in the bright space.

Not only Mount Meru, the highest point on the planet, but also all the ranges, all India tops
were worshiped by the peoples living on its slopes and in her lap. Vindyah Mountains of Satpurah,
Aravalli, of Nilagherry, all had their admirers. In the lowlands, where the faithful had no
mountains to look at, built temples that the streets in fanciful pyramids, huge chunks of granite,
representing the revered peaks of Mount Meru. Perhaps it was a similar feeling of adoration to
the great summits that pushed them to the ancient Egyptians build
the pyramids, artificial mountains rising to dominate the flat surface
of sand and silt.

The island of Ceylon, Lanka "the shining" blessed country which, according to legend East, were
sent the first men through God's mercy, after being expelled Paradise, also rises to the sky
sacred mountains. Such, among others, the isolated peak in the middle of the plains, the holy
city of Anaradjapura. Is the Mihintale. In stop the rock, twenty-two centuries ago, the flight
of Mahinda, the drive Indian was launched from the plains of the Ganges to attract the natives
to the religion of Budha. Today it has built a temple on top where you put your foot saint. Is high
and large Pagoda and yet such is the application of the pilgrims who have covered many times,
from bottom to top, with a tapestry of jasmine. A carbuncle, color of fire, shining at the
top of the monument, reflecting the distance to the sun, and that there was a rajah sent extending
from the top of the mountain to the plains of twelve miles carpet length for non blemished
feet of the faithful a land impure, from a unholy ground.

And yet, this mountain sacred Mihintale is not as glorious as the peak of Adam, sailors are in
the midst of the waves as they approach the island of Ceylon. The footprint of a giant foot
belonging, say, a man ten feet high, is printed in the rock, in the end that crowns the summit. That
mark, as Muslims and Jews, is the Adam, the first man who climbed the peak to see the vast
land, vast forests, the mountains and plains, the banks and the Ocean with its islands and reefs.
According to Ceylon and Indian, not a man but a God who left a trace of their passage. According
to Brahmins, the god Siva was dominant: according to Buddhists, was Buddha, according to the Gnostics
of the early Christian centuries, was the Lord. When the Portuguese landed on the island Ceylon
and conquered, degraded (so to speak) the mountain, which, after the manner of think, could
not compare to the Holy Land: they believe that the mysterious signal is footprint of St. Thomas or
of a former missionary, apostle secondary, Caudaces eunuch. Even less respectful, an Armenian, Moses
Chorene, enthusiastic for his noble mountain of Ararat, is at the top of the peak of the footprint
of Adam Satan, the eternal enemy. Finally, travelers Englishmen, more numerous every day, every
year to climb the holy mountain, believe that "Divine footprint" is nothing but a hole vulgar, grossly
rounded. Truth is that such foreigners are regarded with contempt by the pilgrims going to
believe prostrate to the top, devoutly to kiss the track and to deposit their offerings in
the priest's house. Everything seems testimony to the authenticity of the miracle. A few meters
under the a spring peak flows: the staff of God made him emerge from the soil. Many trees grow
on the slopes, and these trees (as they please the faithful), bow their branches to the summit
to vegetate and grow adoring. The rocks of the mountain is scattered with stones precious:
they are the tears that flowed from the eyes of God saw the suffering and crimes of men. How
have to believe in the miracle, seeing all these riches have given rise to the fabulous tales
of the Thousand and One Nights? The streams that run through the mountain will not crawl, as
our streams, despicable pebbles and sand carry powdered rubies, garnets and sapphires: the swimmer
of all among its waves can roll, like sirens on a bed of stones.

Far Eastern races whose civilization has followed up differently from people Aryan race, have also
worshiped mountains. The same in China and Japan than in India, high peaks hold temples dedicated
to the gods, or they are considered geniuses guardianship or vindictive. The people seeking
her story comes from these mountains divine by traditions and legends.

The mountains are the oldest historical China, because the rule is one of the Middle of the first
people who have come to the self-awareness, the first written his own story of a continuous mode.
Five are the sacred mountains that rise all in regions famous for its agriculture, industry,
the crowds that move in skirt or events that have occurred in their vicinity. The holy mountain,
that of Chan Tai-dominates all other vertices of the rich Chan-Tung Peninsula, between the
two gulfs the Yellow Sea. From the summit, which is reached by a paved road and steps open in
the rock, you can see, spread at the feet of the observer, the rich plains that runs through the
Hoang Ho, now running into one, now to another gulf, off with his thirst for water multitudes
of men outnumber swords in a field.

Emperor Chung climbed to the top four hundred thirty years, as reminiscent of classic country
records. Confucius also wanted to go, but the slope is very rough, the philosopher could not
handle it, and still teaches the place where he began the descent into the plain. All major gods
and geniuses are major temples and oratories in the holy mountain and the clouds, the sky, the Big
Dipper and Polaris. The ten thousand geniuses stop the flight there to survey the land and the
cities of men. "The wind of Tai-Chan is equal to the sky. It is the ruler of the world. Pick up
the clouds and send us rain. Decides births and deaths, misery, misfortune, glory and shame.
Of peaks that rise to heaven, is the most worth visiting. "So the pilgrims numerous flock there to
implore all of you, and the path is littered with caves where filthy beggars lie horrifying wounds
the passerby.

With more reason that the Chinese, because its volcanic mountains are a perfect beauty Thus,
the Japanese look to worship the snowy peaks. There is no idol in the world can be compared
to his magnificent Furiyama, to the "mountain simpa" which stands almost alone in the countryside,
covered under forests, snow clad top. Smoked at one time the volcano and lava and threw fire now
rests, but has at the archipelago numerous Sisters mountains still pouring rivers of fire in
the trembling earth. These mountains there is one, the most terrible, which is believed as an offering
to appease throwing thousands of Christians. It was thus in the New World, it is said also that he
wanted to calm the Monotombo, throwing in him to the priests who had dared to preach against
it, saying it was not such a God, but mouth of hell. On the other hand, volcanoes are often expected
to throw their victims: you know they find when you split the earth, spewing lakes of mud, covered
with ash whole provinces and make them die once the entire population of a country. That's enough
worship for all who bow to the force. The volcano swallows, then is God.

This man has taken the religion of the mountains (as all others), by various feelings of his
being. At the foot of the mountain, spewing lava, terror has prostrated with her face buried in the
dust in the thirsty fields, desire is the one who made you look pleading to the snow, mother
of streams: the appreciation has given those worshipers they found safe refuge in the valley or
on the steep hill, finally, admiration must have been men to dominate as it developed in them a sense
of the beautiful and even when I was asleep, in a state of instinct. And what is the mountain
no issues at once beautiful and safe havens, which is not terrible or beneficial and many sometimes
both together? The villages, walking through the world, could easily relate all their traditions
into the hill that dominated the horizon and to worship. At each station their long journey to
build a new church. At one time, the wandering tribes in the plateaus of Persia were always
emerge at dusk a mountain between the dusty plains: Mount Telesma was the divine 'Talisman'
which was to his worshipers in his travels around the world. And when, after a long migration, mountain
discerned in the distance was not deceptive mirage, but true summit with snow and rocks, who
would have doubted the journey made by God to accompany his people?

This is how the mountain, which tip received the refugees from the
flood, has continued to walk across continents.

Samaritan Pentateuch version holds that Noah's ark stopped at the peak of Adam, the other versions
say that the real peak was on Ararat, but Ararat what is that? Is that of any other mountain ú Armenia,
which have been found for any remains of the sacred pastors boat? For people everywhere claim
East that honor for the protective mountain whose waters irrigate their own fields. That is Mount
from which life came back down to earth, following the path of the snow and the course streams. No
tests have failed, of course, to establish the veracity of all these traditions. We found lots
of prairie petrified under the ice and the same rocks are found traces of those moldy "flood rings"
which, according our modern sages, are fossil ammonites. That's why more than one hundred mountains
of Persia, Syria, Arabia, Asia Minor has been suggested as the patriarch landing, second-parent
men. Greece also spoke of his Parnassus, whose stone thrown into the mud of the flood, became
men. Even in France there are mountains where the ark stood, one of those divine is Chamechaude
peaks near the Grande Chartreuse of Grenoble, another is Puy de Progne, dominant sources of
the Andes.

The myth is thus constant of the high peaks is where men are down. From these fastnesses, throne
of divinity, has the great voice out their duties dictated to mortals.

The God of the Jews lived then at the peak of Sinai, in clouds and lightning, and spoke with the
voice of lightning at people gathered in the plain. The same Baal Moloch and all bloodthirsty gods
of those peoples of the East appeared to the faithful at the top of the mountains. In Stony
Arabia, in the countries of Edom and Moab there is a height, a hill or a rock that is not supporting
its rough stone pyramid on whose altar shed blood to be suitable priests to God. Babel was
missing in the mountains, and replaced it with the famous temple that was going to heaven.
The poet has constructed this gigantic building, not as it was, but as people imagined.

The highest mountain, was a foundation stone for that granite wall.

        With his envious hatred of foreign
        cults, the Jewish prophets cursed more than once the "high places"
in which neighboring towns placed her idols, but they did not come
otherwise, and looked to the mountains to evoke the angels that was
helping: on a mountain raised its temple, also Elijah talking with
God on a mountain.

And when Galileo was transfigured and hovered in the uncreated light with the two prophets Moses
and Elijah from Mount Tabor was raised. When he died between two thieves, on top of a mountain
crucified him, and when he returns, according to prophecy, surrounded by saints and angels,
and attend the punishment of their enemies, so does a mountain, but when touched with the plant
break. Another mountain, another top ideal to hold a city of gold and diamonds will emerge in
Light space and live there always selected, hovering in the air around the peaks happy, well
above this land care and misfortune.

CHAPTER XX

# The Olympus and the gods #

Just as the glory of Greece imperceptible surpassed in brightness
to that of all the empires East and Olympus, the highest and beautiful
of the sacred mountains of the Hellenes, has come to be in the imagination
of people the mountain par excellence: no tops, or Meru, or those
of Elburs, Ararat or Lebanon, awakens in the human spirit so many
memories of grandeur and majesty.

Few have been, of course, so admirably situated to attract attention and serve as a signal to
the races that roamed the world. Placed in angle of the Aegean Sea and dominating all the
surrounding peaks from the middle of its height, saw Olympus sailors from huge distances. From
the plains of Macedonia, from rich valleys of Thessaly, from the mountains Othrys, Findo,
Bermi and Athos, is on the horizon dome and its three remaining "a thousand roughness" of which
Homer speaks. Fertility of fields called out in her lap to himself from all parties to the
crowds there were going to meet, and to mix them, and to kill each other. Finally, Olympus overlooking
the canyons that necessarily had to follow the tribes or armies on the march, from Asia to
Europe or from Greece to the barbarians of the North countries. It stands as a milestone military
the road that were then the nations.

Many other mountains of the Hellenic world to be glittering snow-name Olympus or light, but none
so much as deserved of Thessaly, the summit served throne to the gods.

And is that the same people had spent her childhood Hellenic national
in the valleys and plains, lying under the shadow of the great mountain.

From Thessaly came from the Greeks of Attica and the Peloponnese: there had been fighting with
monsters his early heroes and there his first poets, led by the voice of the muses Pierides,
had composed hymns and songs of victory and joy.

Flooding villages in remote regions, reminded the Greek tribes divine mountain in their cattle
had given them life and nourishment.

Almost all the major events of the mythical story that had been verified in Part of Greece, and
among them, the most important, which decided the control in heaven and earth. Olympus was
the citadel of choice for new gods, and camped around the ancient
deities, the Titans monstrous children of chaos.

Standing in the mountains Othrys, that take place in vast semicircle south, the Giants grabbed
huge rocks, mountains Whole and half flung against Olympus uprooted. To stand up above, heaped
Titans of old forest on the mountain that will serve as a pedestal, but the vast snowy always
dominated them and surrounded with dark clouds from which sprang the rays. Giants, fed with
the very forces of the earth, carrying the voice of the hurricane roars and arms the strength of
the storm, with its hundred hands threw the hail of random rocks, but struggled with the blind fury
of the elements against intelligent young gods. Succumbed, and under the rubble of the mountain
with them were flattened entire villages. Otherwise not the whims of kings have been because of
destruction of nations, as by mistake.
