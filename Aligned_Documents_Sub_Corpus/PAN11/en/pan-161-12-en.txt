 It
is curious to contrast the upper and lower Rhône: the first, throwing over the basin their overflowing
lake gray mud, the second coming of purified lake and clear, as if to symbolize the purity of
morals and clarity of the free institutions Geneva and Vaud. This circumstance, which also shows
in other lakes, such as Brienz and Thun, is explained by the existence, at bottom, a purifying
substance and dye which acts as a powerful reagent.
