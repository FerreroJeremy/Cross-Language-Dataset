  
    
      Welcome
    
    
      
        Before I give you the floor, Commissioner, let me first extend a welcome on behalf of this House to the members of a delegation from the People's Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery above.
      
      
        I would like to extend a very warm and special welcome to all of the delegation headed by His Excellency, Dr Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, the Vice-Chair of the People's Consultative Assembly.
      
      
        Indonesia is a key EU partner in South-East Asia.
        Indeed, it is the leading country in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with whom the European Union signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in November 2009, and currently holds the chair of ASEAN.
      
      
        Our two parliaments have an excellent relationship.
        A delegation from Parliament visited Indonesia just a few months ago.
        It is therefore a great pleasure to be able to welcome our friends and counterparts from the Indonesian Parliament today.
        We hope that your visit will be fruitful and beneficial.
      
      
        (Applause)
