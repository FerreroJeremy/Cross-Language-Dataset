      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I consider it my duty to thank the shadow rapporteurs and everyone who helped to formulate the text we are voting on today.
        It is a text the basic criterion of which is the protection of individual rights.
        It is yet another - I would say positive - step in the further development of mutual trust between Member States during their cooperation on criminal matters.
        It is a step towards the unification of criminal law and, at the same time, it is a new step which leads to equality in the eyes of the law between citizens of the Member States, wherever they may be within the territory of the European Union.
      
      
        I should like to ask my fellow members to place their trust in this directive.
