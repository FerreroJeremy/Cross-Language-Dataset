        Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for the delay.
        There was a very exciting and interesting discussion between President Barroso, Commissioner Lewandowski and the leaders of the political groups, so we are a few minutes late.
        There is now a very important discussion ahead of us and I would like to invite you to this discussion.
