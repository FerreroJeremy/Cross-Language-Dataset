        (DE) Mr President, my apologies but, throughout the course of the day, I have listened to a right-wing Hungarian extremist speak about Hungary under every item.
        Please could you point out that we have an agenda with separate items.
        Perhaps the Member is unaware of that.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
    
    
      
        Unfortunately, the Member is not present.
        I assume that she will take note of your comment.
