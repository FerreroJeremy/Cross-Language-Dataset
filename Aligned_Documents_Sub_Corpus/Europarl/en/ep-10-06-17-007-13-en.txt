        Mr President, we propose an oral amendment to paragraph 9 that is factually incorrect.
        We would like to delete 'world disarmament' in the first line, as the Six-Party Talks are not disarmament talks but denuclearisation talks.
        The final wording would then be 'Calls on the countries in the Six-Party Talks to continue working together to ensure that the talks on ending the DPRK nuclear programme are resumed'.
