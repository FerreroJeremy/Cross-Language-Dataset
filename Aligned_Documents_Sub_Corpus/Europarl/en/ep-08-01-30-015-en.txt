        I welcome to our official gallery a delegation from the European Affairs Committee of the Polish Parliament, headed by Mr Andrzej Grzyb, Chairman of the Committee.
        The delegation is on a three-day fact-finding visit to the European Parliament, and I had the pleasure of meeting its members yesterday.
        I bid you all a warm welcome.
      
      
        (Applause)
