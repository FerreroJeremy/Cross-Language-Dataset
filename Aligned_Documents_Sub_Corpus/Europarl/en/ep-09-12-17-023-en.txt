        Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the last sitting of this year.
        I am pleased that the new Members have settled in so well over the last few months.
        I wish you all a Happy Christmas and a successful start to 2010.
        I hope that you will all be able to say at the end of 2010 that it was a good year.
      
      
        I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
      
      
        (The sitting was closed at 16.10)
