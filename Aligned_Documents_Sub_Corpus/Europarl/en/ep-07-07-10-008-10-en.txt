      - Before the vote
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, it is about an important dossier in the area of commitology.
        I shall not trouble the House for long, but I should like us to be able to vote against the first part of the European Parliament's amendment and in favour of the second part.
        I think all Members will have understood the importance of this vote.
      
    
    
      
        Thank you, Mrs Berès.
        So we are voting only on the second part.
