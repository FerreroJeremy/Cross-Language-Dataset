        Mr President, we have just had two roll-call votes.
        This morning before lunch, we had only two roll-call votes.
        It is the ruling in this Parliament that you have to vote over 50% of the time, and 50% of the roll-call votes, to ensure that you get a full day's pay.
        Is this correct in this case, or what is the situation?
      
    
    
      
        It is correct.
        You have to be present 50% of the time.
