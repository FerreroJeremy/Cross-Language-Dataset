      - Before the vote
    
    
      
        (DE) Madam President, allow me to point out an error in the voting list of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
        In the vote on the legal basis, Amendment 39, we should be listed with a minus instead of a plus.
