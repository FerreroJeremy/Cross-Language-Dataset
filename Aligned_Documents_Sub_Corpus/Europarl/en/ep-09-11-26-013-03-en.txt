      China: Minority rights and application of the death penalty (vote)
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, excuse me, but there is an error in paragraph 3 of the German version and I would like to ask you to have it corrected there and, if necessary, in all the other language versions.
        The German version reads: 'Condemns the execution of the two Tibetans and another nine Uighurs'.
        Of course, this is incorrect.
        Uighurs are not other Tibetans and Tibetans are not other Uighurs.
        I would like to ask you to have this corrected in all the language versions.
      
    
    
      
        Mr Posselt, thank you, that will be corrected.
      
    
    
      
        That concludes the vote.
