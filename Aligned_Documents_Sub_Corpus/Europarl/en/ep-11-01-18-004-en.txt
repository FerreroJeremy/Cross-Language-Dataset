        Before we move on down the list of speakers, I would just like to take the opportunity to bid welcome to a guest who is following our debate today, namely, Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Božidar Đelić.
        A very warm welcome to you, Mr Đelić.
        It is nice to have you with us.
