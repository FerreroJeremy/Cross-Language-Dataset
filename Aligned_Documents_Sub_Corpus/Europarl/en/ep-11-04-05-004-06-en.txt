      - Before the final vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote has produced a result that may be the subject of debate, however we are now very close to the position of the Council and, with the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs, I would ask that the final vote should be postponed because it is very probable that we shall be able to reach complete agreement with the Council.
