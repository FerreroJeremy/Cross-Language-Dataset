      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        Madam President, I rise under Rules 9, 93 and 94, which deal with transparency, to declare that I have an interest in relation to the issues to be voted and so will not be participating in this vote.
        I similarly declared an interest when we considered this matter in committee and did not participate in the discussion or the vote on that occasion.
