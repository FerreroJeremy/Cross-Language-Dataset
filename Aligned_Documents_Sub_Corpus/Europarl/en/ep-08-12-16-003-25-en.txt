        Mr President, while the Vice-President of the Commission is in her seat could I pass on a request to her in her position as Commissioner responsible for communication?
        A month ago Parliament's Baltic Europe Intergroup passed a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit, a matter of great importance to this House.
        We have not yet received an acknowledgement, never mind a reply.
        Could she perhaps raise this with colleagues in the Commission?
        It is a matter of great importance to this House.
      
    
    
      
        Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, yes, of course I will follow up on that.
        I will make sure that you get a reply as soon as possible.
