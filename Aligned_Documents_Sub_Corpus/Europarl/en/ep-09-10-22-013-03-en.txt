        Mr President, I suggest that we remove recital 3 from the resolution, because the situation of the journalist Ti Sei Nayagam is only mentioned at the beginning and not in the operative part of the resolution.
        We removed this item from our agenda during our joint negotiations.
        I therefore recommend that this issue should be deleted here.
        We shall certainly have an opportunity to discuss this issue again another time.
