        I think this situation - one of a certain crisis in relations between Parliament and the Council - points to the need for the European Parliament to put greater pressure on the Council concerning greater transparency over budgetary expenditure.
        In view of the Treaty of Lisbon in particular, which increases the role of the European Parliament, this is simply indispensable.
