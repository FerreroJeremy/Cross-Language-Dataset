      Before the vote:
    
    
      
        Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask you to support my request that the vote on my report be taken by roll call.
        I have informed the shadow rapporteurs of this and my understanding is that they support this.
        I believe that that will more clearly highlight the broad support which the report has received in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
        Thank you for your understanding.
