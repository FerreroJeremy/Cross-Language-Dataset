      Compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on paragraph 15(2):
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, shortly before the vote, my attention was drawn to a problem that is very easily solved.
        Paragraph 15 reads: 'intends to this end to amend Rule 34 of its Rules of Procedure'.
        As we need a different majority for Rules of Procedure than for this vote, many Members find the word 'intends' too strong.
      
      
        I would therefore suggest amending paragraph 15 as follows: 'is to this end considering an amendment to the Rules of Procedure'.
        I hope the PPE-DE Group will also be able to agree to amending the Rule in this way.
      
      
        (Parliament adopted the oral amendment)
