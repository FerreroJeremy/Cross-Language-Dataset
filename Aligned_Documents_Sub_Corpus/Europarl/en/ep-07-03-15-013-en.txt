        Mr President, when I spoke during the discussion on the Galina Kozlova case, I expressed my gratitude to our colleagues from the PPE-DE Group Mr Kelam, Mr Landsbergis and Mr Tannock for initiating that resolution.
        I was informed later that the original initiative came from our Estonian colleague Mr Savi from the ALDE Group.
        I should therefore like to express my respect and gratitude to him.
      
    
    
      
        (PL) On Nigeria, I voted in favour of the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
        I do not consider it a good one, but I believe that adopting the joint resolution tabled by the Left would bring far more discredit on the House.
        I believe the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party is a better way forward.
      
    
    
      
        I would remind you that there are no explanations of vote concerning emergency matters.
      
    
    
      
        (FR) Mr President, I would just like to add a word to what Mr Libicki said: the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats's motion was not the result of a compromise.
      
    
    
      
        That concludes the explanations of vote.
      
      
        Before closing the sitting, I have some more announcements to make.
