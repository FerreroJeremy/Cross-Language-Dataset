        Mr President, I would like to change paragraph 14 to the following: 'Reiterates its call to the government of Pakistan to carry out a thoroughgoing review of the blasphemy laws and their current application, including the mandatory death penalty or life imprisonment prescribed by Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code for anyone found guilty of blasphemy against the prophet Mohammed, with a view to implementing amendments as suggested by the Federal Minister for Minority Affairs'.
