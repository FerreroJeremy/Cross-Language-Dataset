        Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our President, Mr Pöttering, I must sadly inform you of the death of the former European Commissioner George Thomson, who later became Lord Thomson of Monifieth.
        Together with Lord Soames, he was one of the first two British Commissioners.
        A former minister George Thomson passed away last week at the age of 87.
