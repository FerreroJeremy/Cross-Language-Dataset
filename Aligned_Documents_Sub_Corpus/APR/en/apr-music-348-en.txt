i did not build this at home but i have two best-of that gathers the main tracks from this cd. james brown is an incomparable artist, an extraordinary talent not to be underestimated. i think unfortunately it has been many times. just look at his work to discover that it is unique and there will never be an artist of this stature in the genre. a have absolutely, obviously, but does not neglect his other records!
