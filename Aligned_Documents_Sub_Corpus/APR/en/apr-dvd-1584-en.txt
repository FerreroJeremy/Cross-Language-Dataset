i received by amazon, the dvd yesterday morning. that evening, i'm wedged into the couch, and i stayed glued to the 2 dvd. i was at the concert in paris, and the live dvd, if you have a good technical facility, excellently well makes the musical show. i am a little bit more reserved on the images: fortunately, mylène is always brighter and more beautiful on film, but the change of plans, too many, hack magic of the whole, including all special effects on the cross (stage b). hence the need to purchase the collector, because in the dique bonus, "angel speaks me" and "before the shadows" are filmed differently (wide shot) and make that magic, including the deluge which effects are best showcased in the bonus disc. a dvd that will not have time to take the dust.
