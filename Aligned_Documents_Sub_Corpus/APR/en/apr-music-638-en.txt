what a fantastic album. i listen loop. tracks written by unknown blend nicely with those of voulzy. nolwenn's voice and interpretation are sublime. the text is to listen and digest. i am particularly touched by "my angel" whose text me upside down with every listen. i lost my father to cancer last year and the words spoken by nolwenn are those that i could not express but i felt so painfully ... in summary, do not miss out on this artist and this record.
