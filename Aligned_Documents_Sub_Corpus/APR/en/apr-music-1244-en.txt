it does not change a recipe that works ..... the second album by mariah carey is a copy of his first album but with less features .. less intense in the least! indeed side walks there are only two sublime "can not let go" and "the wind" or possibly "till the end of time" which derive their game well, other ballads such as "and you do not remember, "if it's over" and "so blessed" remain flat after listening to a share of ballads from the first album but especially compared to "can not let go" and "the wind" ! of course, they are nevertheless good ballads, very pleasant to listen but they are less exceptional. this is valid for ballads is unfortunately also the up tempo songs! apart from the excellent "emotions" and the correct "you're so cold" the rest is rather flat image of the single "make it happen" and "to be around you" now, as i said previously, these songs are not bad but no surprises or was sometimes hard to catch! in short this is probably the album i listen to mariah least .. this is still a good album from the diva that we must have!
