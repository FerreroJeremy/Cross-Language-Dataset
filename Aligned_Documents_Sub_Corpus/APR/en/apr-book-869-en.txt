i had to criticize my famous namesake. prompted by the similarity of our names, i bought without prejudice his 1st book ... review: besides the fact that this book is nothing but a copy of a parody book barjavel, mixed with the movie "ghost" came out long before the book past the shaker and shaken, it is much more poorly written in a style school, lifeless, uninspired. marc levy produces bestselling books, exhilarating to some, as are the perfumes of supermarkets: heady, flattering at first but quickly boring, too trivial, no character! but, as some singers from a famous "academy", these products are made to be sold and popular ... they are duly noted. but they are to literature what macdonalds is to gourmet. fat, sweet, but they quickly leave a stomach ache before the interstellar void. i sometimes feel better write that my namesake ... well, i must think!
