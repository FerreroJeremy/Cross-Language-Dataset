the new format is all-in-fact necessary and appropriate in the continuity of the introduction of the "script" which appeared in book iv. the side "skits" is still present since the first volumes (one volume = one episode, there are 8 episodes of 50 minutes) v this book are built around some stories that are developing in parallel with the sequences of two to three minutes. in the last volumes, the focus is almost exclusively placed on the trail of king arthur. all the characters we love from the beginning of the series are present with their traits if ... characteristics. chabat, decaunes, rolin and keyboard are outstanding with particular reference to the character played by chabat and rolin. the first volumes are more strippers and funny that the last two. how the serious, tragic and profound mingle with the stupidity, the comic and the ridiculous touches almost to genius. the evolution of king arthur over the volumes of this book is very involved and alexandre astier plays remarkably well (notice that only my opinion ... it touched me and there is essential). i also enjoyed the relationship with guinevere and the new interest and arthur himself is growing over the volumes. the character of the latter is unquestionably deep. what a surprise, what a beautiful evolution. to say that i put 5 stars in previous books. i would put six good one that i taped and i devoured in two nights. pfffffffffffff ... say that the book is already 5 while saying it must now wait a year ... and then ... ? with the board? go yes ... i'll take a small lead going to give me this wonderful book v. mr astier, ladies and gentlemen who surround, i tip my hat. minor edit of 20/12/2008. i urge to see the interview with alexandre astier is on the dvd addemdum.
