this film is absolutely superb. a feast for the eyes and ears, disney has hit hard. the sets underground, underwater and submerged city is simply beautiful (attack of the creature underwater is a great moment). the scenario is quite correct, it has some intrigue, some mysteries that provide more. well, this is not the greatest plot in the history of cinema, stay in disney! but we are entitled to some interesting twists. humor is also to go through many crazy characters as the italian explosives expert, the french completely obsessed with the land he digs and especially the old granny who smokes like a firefighter and specialist radio. but the main goal of atlantis is the visual wonder that the crisis of laughter. for cons, the big weakness of the film is the character design. the inhabitants of antlantide are very well drawn, while remaining very typical painting style of disney. but the other characters ... what need to draw fingers, famous noses, arms and chin square and angular, which are more reminiscent of playmobil? why not draw like all the inhabitants of atlantis? well, it was necessary that i find lacking in this film and it is the only worry. but unless disney has tried to launch a new style of drawing characters "earthlings" are among the least well drawn of disney's modern history. a very beautiful film despite everything, i told you its only fault so do not deprive yourself! add to this the bonus classics of a making a genesis, a deleted scene ...
