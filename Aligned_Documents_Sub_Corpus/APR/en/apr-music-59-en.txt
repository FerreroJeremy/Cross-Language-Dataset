it seems impossible to note severely new. i was gratified last opus air one star and my comment is not passed. where it touches the boundaries of interactive democracy. we're here to sell records, so we do not speak ill of the heads of gondolas! well, rebelotte anyway. i put two stars but i do not think less. as we already foresaw with pocket symphony, air is a group that has very little to say. at least their previous album contained a few wonders like left bank or the sea of japan. nothing like this for an album that sounds terribly hollow. three plays attentive (he is a fan who speaks) do not undermine the initial impression. all this is well produced but where are the melodies that we were soaring through the galaxy? a big shot so well, then, and an embarrassing question: the source is it dry?
