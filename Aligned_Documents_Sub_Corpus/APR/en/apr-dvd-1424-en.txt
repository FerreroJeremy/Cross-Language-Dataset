this film is really great. it combines impressive footage of a team of firefighters in the heat of the action and focuses on the life and work of one of them. all this leaves followed with great pleasure and interest to these guys who risk their skins for the other. the film is mounted with a lot of emotion and especially sequences of fire and explosion breathtaking. the duo stars (phoenix and travolta) takes part in the success of all. contribution hd: convincing. this image is clearly hd there is no doubt about it. overall, however, we regret a bit of lack of definition in many ways. nothing dramatic, however, the picture is very beautiful but we could see better in blu ray. it is true that the film extenuating circumstances such as smoke not really advantageous for the definition. some sequences are nonetheless magnified by the hd including fire and some explosions really well made. we believe it! otherwise virtually no default, the colors are rich blacks who otherwise would have been a little more dense, and depth of field is appreciable. the silver grain is present but relatively quiet and not spoil anything. we therefore entitled to a very good transfer to dvd rather than who really deserves it. its side, it's all good with vo and vf in hd for a total immersion (everything seems to crumble around ...). maybe not top the demo, but a transfer of high order.
