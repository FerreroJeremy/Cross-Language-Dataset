frédéric encel seems to have opted for the confusion in his book "geopolitics of the apocalypse". indeed, the demonstrations he makes are very partisan and is summarized in a single vision: islam is violent, and the state of israel like the united states prove this. the theory of "clash of civilizations" is widely supported by encel, most importantly the price of the deformation history (cf. the wars waged by the arabs throughout history, according encel). besides qu'encel seems deliberately opt for an arab-muslim confusion, which is a shame and joined the theories of alexander del valle. frankly, i regret buying this book, finally, is simplistic and reductive of the complexity of the middle east and image qu'encel deliberately seeks to give.
