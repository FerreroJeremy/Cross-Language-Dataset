one word for this runaway media-name: ridiculous! the creator of this dark manual could not imagine a better advertising than the complaint of the main question which has resulted in immediate sales boost. how can we save almost 15 euros in a similar folly, beyond any political or religious (attention to this kind of ritual that does not laugh at all in the tropics ...). a farce that only our consumer society gorged, sated and on the lookout for any mercantile futility in secrecy. for this type of doll effigy of kim jong il, a khadafi, a mobutu, reportedly there to blow a real symbolic value, would not bring a penny to its initiators lit ... a contempt.
