the film is not bad, i've seen better, but builds quality asian films is so high that resists evil comparisons with other films of historical air (like "the warlords" or "red cliff ", for example). but the picture quality is pretty bad. a poor transfer that gives bands in too many pictures, especially those months illuminated. i saw the blu-ray version of hong kong ( "an empress and the warriors", all zones) and the image is impeccable, perfect. plus, the hong kong version of this soundtracks 7.1, and french, of 5.1 only. in short, bad french edition, buy the hong kong edition of the film if you want.
