here is a great surprise .... i do not know what group formed by members of pearl jam and aic among others, it is simply beautiful and i emphasize this word. for those looking for a rock band composed for demanding well you make the right choice! great diversity of styles on this album, the ballad of pure hard rock, jazz accents here and there, everything is there, especially the singer's voice of aic. feel more, go for it!
