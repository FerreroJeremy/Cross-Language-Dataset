i do not understand why this series is so popular. not only does lack of originality it (the stories of secret societies and conspiracies abound), but in addition it has its share of contradictions and improbabilities. when developing a conspiracy theory, it must be more credible than that presented to us in this series! other minor but irritating detail how assassins ultracompétents can they be left in the presence of heroes? the cream of assassins intimidated by a bookworm, he was thinking! i could compile a long list of contradictions and improbabilities, but i do not want a review of twenty pages or reveal too much "punch" to those who will read the series despite my recommendation. for everything in this series is built around the "punch" and the "punch", and often very hollywood cliche, always takes precedence over historical accuracy and consistency of the narrative. no work is perfect, but when it accumulates all the improbabilities and contradictions especially, i do not see how he can appreciate. i read the entire series, saying that a flash of genius screenwriter would reverse the trend and show us that the lack of discipline was one of the characters and not hers, but that lightning never comes.
