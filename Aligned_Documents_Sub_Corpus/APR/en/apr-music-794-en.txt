big fan of whitney houston since its beginning back to life and to stop its destruction delight me. but what a disappointment. this album is no ordinary attraction. the voice is still there but it is completely empty melodies and predictable especially calibrated to the extreme. the horror of the massacre is "a song for you" as classical and sublime donny hathaway stock up in a ridiculous tempo. one could expect from a singer like him to experience an interpretation that carries with it the glorious heritage of music including african american whitney is part of his career as a singer who started in gospel, like all the greatest performers of his generation. in short get at the starlets rnb soup today is a sad challenge for a singer of this quality. it is very sad.
