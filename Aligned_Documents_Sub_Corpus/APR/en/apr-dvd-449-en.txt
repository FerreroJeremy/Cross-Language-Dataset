"d'oh!" : it's good to re-hear the small expressions (winks to simpson, the wizard of oz, etc ...) of this dear colonel o'neill! after months of waiting, stargate sg-1 back with this ultimate - season 7. fans and amateur, you'll have everything! action (the final episode dual must-see), comedy (richard dean anderson, though unfortunately less present even if one suspects, is back with his unique humor), romance (well a shift in the relationship jack &amp; sam! huh? who said anything about the settlement?) and other surprises, happy or sad (see heroes, parts i &amp; ii). enough writing, run buy the ultimate, until season 8 on tv.
