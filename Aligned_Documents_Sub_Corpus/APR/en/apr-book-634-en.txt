as a practicing catholic, i would normally wear a favorable ruling on this book ... well no! i am appalled that this book conveys extremely reactionary ideas on topics such as divorce and homosexuality (which is not a sin, whatever the conservatives of all kinds). a catechism when a more open, humanistic, and thus closer to god?
