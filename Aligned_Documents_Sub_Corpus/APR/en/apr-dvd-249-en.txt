the dvd case does not lie: "the new fear comes from asia"! this film is wonderful, enchanting and ... mortal. the story is simple and yet we let them take and lights out, we dare not move from his chair. the french version is excellent, respecting word for word the japanese version, and the voices are great. the bonus "the k7 cursed" is also superb: the look and ... suffer the revenge of the ghost of sadako! the trilogy "the ring" itself as a japanese cult movie from the first vision! oh one last tip. if you love the original version, with a "ring", you will enjoy.
