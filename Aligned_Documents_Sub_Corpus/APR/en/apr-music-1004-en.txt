honestly! you find the property is "sniff upper lip"? . recognize that even when the hard bluesy australians have never been less than inspired on this album. ok! i grant you that the introductory piece is really nice, "hold me back" and staccato notes like "can not stand still" also lend themselves to tap your feet, but the rest ... whether this is winded. i do not mind also that phil rudd was saving the cheek, but is not there! we no longer talk of economy, is squarely within the feinéantise (tchicai tchicai boom boom ...). when brian johnson, his course called "cap yelling" there also appears to me completely usurped. the age!? well yes and then! dio, coverdale, gillan, what age you think they have? . the singer sketch, trying to veil the face, but let us not be fooled, it no longer comes from the belly but the back of the throat; moreover, i note also that during the promo tour for the album, only 1 piece was played throughout the set. during the tour "razors edge" and "ballbreaker" songs from their new album respective numbers were counted to 5 or 6. from there, i think everything is said. in the wise. 08/20
