a powerful novel, very beautiful but also very dark. the first part stands out for its cruelty, the characters are all very hard, not to mention the colonial bureaucracy, corrupt and unjust. the relationship between susan, his brother and their mother's mother, on the verge of madness, are conflicting, sometimes cruel, their relationships to others as well. the description of women who give birth every year, children who are dying by the hundreds in the indifference of the drowned plains, the sweltering heat, the end of all hope, all this contributes to give a sensation of numbness, d ' crash. the second part is more intense, with more endearing characters such as carmen, the daughter of a whore with perfect legs. all ends happily on a vague hope, that of freedom.
