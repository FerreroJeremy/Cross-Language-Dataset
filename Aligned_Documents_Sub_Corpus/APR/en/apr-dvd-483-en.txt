if it was feared the worst to see a production deal with the american kung-fu, with jet li and jackie chan headlining, we must recognize that the surprise is even better. if the scenario is quite basic, we still leaves board early in this story of a young american fan of kung-fu and found himself thrown into the world he is a fan. for once we realize that the director u.s. is respectful of original material, and suddenly the film is really successful. it is still surrounded by yuen woo-ping in martial arts choreographer (which is just a reference) and peter pau photography (which is also a leader in his field). so, there is fighting cable and air very successful and often very dramatic, and we sailed in beautiful scenery. the director is doing very well, because here mountpoint epileptic camera with scrapie (which is, in many recent movies, a little tiring in the long run), but plans very successful, well framed, which that the action scenes are still very readable and enjoyable to watch. in addition, we see fairly quickly that helping u.s. studio, the budget is up to in terms of special effects, stunts, costumes, which is enjoyable. note also a very beautiful music by david buckley. finally, jackie chan and jet li are clearly in great shape in this film and give the best of themselves for fighting still very entertaining. each has 2 roles in the film. a lot of adventure and humor to a mainstream film to recommend.
