this album is a milestone in the career of marillion! they include a new singer (steve hogarth), whose voice contrasts with that of fish. warmer, less high-pitched, often whispered, it adapts well to changing musical approach of the group. this album is an accumulation of securities to slow, rather melancholy where the group then fish evolved in a more mysterious, combining suspense with surprise. the musical quality remains the same but it is true that the whole work appears much less inspired and much softer (not less than 4 ballads of 9 titles) than previous albums. in short, a good album for background music, no more! however, in my view, three titles deserve special attention: "easter", "after me" and the very rock 'hooks in you ".
