i am a big fan from germany and i was very happy to read there will be a blu-ray version of that sensational concert. i was so disappointed when i received the blu-ray! the quality equals exactly the dvd version. it does not look like a hd version at all! just compare the blu-rays from celine dion in vegas or justin timberlake. they are exeptional!
