... that is fabulous. we may like or dislike the pumpkins, but we can not deny the incredible impact they had on the rock. for my part i love is even my favorite band. how could i miss this dvd, i expected since the invention of impatience? i am served: all videos, full, sometimes with several tracks of reviews, bonuses and an original song and two live. and everyone knows that the videos of this group are among the most innovative, most beautiful and interesting world of rock ( "tonight, tonight", "1979"; "ava adore", etc ... can forget?). what's more images of shootings, menus with some superb music novel (which is now on the best of). so, hardcore or not, here is a dvd to find among all fans of alternative music. very beautiful.
