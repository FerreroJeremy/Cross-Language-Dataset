i agree that i have not really attached to this monument of the literature of science fiction. if the decor (giant towers of self-sufficient) and the starting premise is interesting (and show us perhaps what not to do for our pseudo-civilized society), the story brought new acollées quickly becomes boring and ultimately little exciting.
