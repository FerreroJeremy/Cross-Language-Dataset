go, 1 star for the successful special effects, and 1 other to the unintentional humor. despite the mystery that the director tries to cast on the futuristic bunker where our hero, we do not care a bit, we fear almost knowing that, far from being original, it might even be disappointing. but let's say for an hour, despite the onslaught of ads for x-box, pouma and co., the film leaves look. it feels no masterpiece, it even feels good film, but the kind that remains strangely sober and so pleasant a movie sunday night somehow. then the second part of the movie happens, accumulating disasters: primarily the weapon of the future that is more ridiculous, a gun that is used as a fishing rod. at first i could not even laugh because i could not believe it. then, the band of mercenaries, "meuchants" film, initiating a chase infernal totally unnecessary and unlikely 30 minutes to try to catch up with our heroes (unsuccessfully? ... well yes ...), sequence which extends the length of the film, finally putting an end to our illusions. once we know the trouble to lie, it's a turnip. with the shift action was right in passing ... tin tin tin ... emotion! obiwan and scarlett blondonson discovers they have hormones and fiddling feverishly, discovering the joys of sex with mythical phrases like "wow?" what's that thing with your tongue in my mouth? "ooh! it's great! "... we hit bottom? not yet unfortunately. towards the end everything becomes truly catastrophic including the blink of an absolute bad taste to the gas chambers, some nods to the liberation of black slaves, wholesale cline everything and anything to give crédibilté, and the futuristic building of the future crumbling because we cut the power?! there are 10 or 15 years, the hero of this kind of turnip were arnold schwarzouilléguerre or rambo sylvester. now, hollywood actors prefer ridicule credible.
