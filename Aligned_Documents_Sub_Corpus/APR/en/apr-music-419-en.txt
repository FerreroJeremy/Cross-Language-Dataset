this disc is fascinating and the remastered sound is excellent and powerful. 6 pieces of happiness. music inspired, full of energy, "positive vibes". musicians with exceptional talent for improvisation. we must put this together in context, in january 1972, just over a year after the death of jimi hendrix at the beginning of the decline in psychedelic movement, the consolidation of new styles like hard rock, the emergence of funk, disco, the division of genres, the imminent withdrawal of american troops from vietnam, the first defeat of the superpower, the cold war and tearing deep social. the piece 6, free form funkafide filth, is alone worth buying the disc. in 25 minutes of hypnotic jam and just a few sentences, he expresses the transition to a new world. "the whole world's in trouble, running right and left, you'd better hold on to what you've got brother! and look out for yourself, they said you've gotta take care of yourself"
