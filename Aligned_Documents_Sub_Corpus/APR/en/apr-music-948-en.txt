a pleasant surprise that this return of pumpkins! billy corgan found a little fishing beginning with simple components and square and melodies without being too effective-aignan aignan. it avoids a double trap: that of trying to follow fashion, and to prosecute his personal whims conceptual album not always top these days. the album is fairly consistent in quality and the sequencing of songs, and pleasant, even if we rarely find the little stroke of genius that would make it a masterpiece to mellon collie. a little originality still to my mind: "united states", a piece of 10 minutes trippant enough of a genre almost -stoner. frankly if you loved the pumpkins it's worth it. it was feared a big failure, it is not! but if you wait for this album as the messiah you are still a little disappointed. remains that they are back!
