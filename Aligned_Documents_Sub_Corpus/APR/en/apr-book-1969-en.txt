i recommend this book to anyone for the simple reason that i think this book repels more than anything else ... thinking debunk a book that would keep me in suspense "to dan brown," i was very disappointed. we never see where they want to come, the plot is nonexistent and they never bite into the unfolding events. i did not go to the end, perhaps it is more full of surprises as the first but the view of other comments above me, i think i do well not to go after, would have been a waste of time.
