in fact, i give the title of lack of clarity in my comment because that was my general to get involved deeply in history. there are many technical terms on military equipment and many russian names (we ended up mixing and no longer follow the thread of the story). this would have deserved a greater fluidity. i have not read this book with pleasure that i expected, it is reserved for insiders of the art of war.
