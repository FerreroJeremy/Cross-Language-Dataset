in this time of rush on anything that affects directly or indirectly to michael jackson, it is good to show some dicerni. as part of this album in particular, go your way. released several years after the worldwide success of "thriller" and the ultimate testimony of recording with michael jacksons, the songs on this disc would have stayed in the closet. how producers, mick jagger (in duio with michael on one track) and the jacksons themselves have believed in this unidentified object musically? such bad songs, so badly produced can be described as cynical attempt to extort money from a gullible public, or even worse, lack of inspiration and artistry.
