this dvd is one of my favorites. especially for composing the songs funky set. it's very energetic, full of life and are great musicians (maceo parker, prince, other brass instruments, drummer, etc. ..). the flat i believe that the other songs are less funk. but still, buy this dvd it is essential!:)
