very interesting book, logic, and no doubt reflects many years of education and experience. a true mastery of the subject illustrated many examples and feedback. it is just a shame that the style is not a little more humble, which is sometimes annoying. for those that migraine is suffering terribly, you'll find a practical remedy, simple and effective.
