the interpretations of fabio biondi can not leave anyone indifferent: if they brought a revival in the interpretation of baroque to the early 1990s, honesty recommend to flee his latest album. the main criticisms are always the same: aggressive allegros, sacrifice and adagios andantes, no flexibility in the joints between the different movements ... coached by his excesses, fabio biondi did not realize he no longer played vivaldi but was now of biondi. what torture that hearing the concerto for four violins rv 553, which seems unknown to the catalog or even biondi solo in the concerto rv 569, which does not appear to be in the autograph score. if you want an interpretation that "moves" without excesses that we meet here, go to jean-christophe spinosi and his ensemble matheus (pierre verany) or the ensemble zefiro (opus 111).
