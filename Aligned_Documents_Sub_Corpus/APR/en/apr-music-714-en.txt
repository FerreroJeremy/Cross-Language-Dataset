alex beaupain then back again for a much anticipated album. i was lucky to find these songs on stage (at the black ball) and i bought the album a few days later. there is a little more levity in the 33 laps but the last song will come as a terrible reminder, make unexpected gravity. alex beaupain do not go on tv, i rarely hear on the radio, yet it is an artist valuable to discover very quickly.
