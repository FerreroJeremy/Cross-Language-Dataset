this novel does not read. he eats. we are constantly torn between reason and passion. between the desire to see the utopia of the city camundos materialize and allow everyone to live in happiness and the desire to see the republic triumphed. each of the characters is endearing. all beings are tortured, complicated, illuminated, in a quest for mystical, esoteric see humanist. and all need a guide that they found in the person of the adviser. a strange, indefinable, inaccessible, half-prophet, half-illuminated. a beautiful novel that raises many reflections still very current!
