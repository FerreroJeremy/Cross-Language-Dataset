clearly this is not the best album of queens. me, i was expecting something huge, especially after hearing the single "sick, sick, sick" in preview. the sound is really rough, you'd listen to old audio cassette on a poor hi-fi. we feel that there is a desire to create a new sound. on some songs, it goes a little in every sense and in the end it goes wrong. however, there are some very nice tracks: the most excellent "run, pig, run" or "turnin on the screw" and "river in the road". this is a good rock album, nothing more. you can always unwind by listening again to the killings of previous albums.
