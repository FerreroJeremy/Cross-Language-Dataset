i saw this film when it was released and i loved it, but it is desirable to see a second time because the action taken by you forget the little details that make the plot. well it all for you say i loved this movie, although we doubt that whitaker is a scoundrel, there is still a good plot, led by keanu reeves very comfortable in this kind of role (too sexy i ' adores) and a crystal evans very convincing. a good movie to watch again and again possibly
