i agree, the first volume is better, he would renew the concept. but that winks tasty! and it's still a great lesson that we give these heroes of the past: we take in hand, do not give up. whether michelangelo, agatha christie, cyrano, they commit us to move our buttocks and we cling to our dreams. it's not just a joke in the comics, right? the comic about death, there are many, but which makes you want to live, much less. i sign for a volume 3!
