small precision the cd sleeve made here is that the album "after the storm" but the tracklisting is that of "all eyez on me" i am therefore the commentary track listing! this album is flawless! is an import that was released just before the album "after the storm", which indeed most of the songs of this import are listed! in fact, the perfect "u should've known better," "the song i wrote," "breaks my heart," "is not gonna cry no more" and "what hurts the most 'is featured on" after the storm " ! other songs like "i'm back," "all eyez on me (darkchild production)," if u were the girl "(jermaine dupri) and" just another girl "are very good tempo up! a note the recovery of the melody notorious bi g "hypnotize" on the title "i'm back". and finally, we add three beautiful ballads "u deserve", "searchin '" and "what my heart says" and it therefore gives a perfect album! monica is really an artist who deserves to be noticed more in france than it is now! albums to get!
