when read alice miller or dr. thomas gordon, one simply can not adhere to such advice. the approach, highly behaviorist (behavioral), is "correct" behavior that we dislike, not lead us to ask questions (on ourselves as parents, about what a problem behavior. ..) for those who like the method "as you're under my roof, you obey" and who want to "shape" their child is ok. to those who believe that the child is a person, i recommend reading i. filliozat: "at the heart of the emotions of the child" or "educating without punishing" and "effective parenting" by dr. gordon.
