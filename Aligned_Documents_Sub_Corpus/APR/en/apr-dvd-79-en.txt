whenever i see titanic, i can not help me that everything would have been much better, there is some sloppiness in many aspects. rather than this love as a scenario, i rather seen an ensemble film, such that almost always found in the disaster movie, is to tell a story without the main character, but where several players are treated equally (or almost), as deep impact, for example . that would have to see more in depth each class, but also engineers, commanders, etc.. here, they are only very very minor characters in the background. here, i find the choice quite incoherent narrative, a survivor of the titanic has testified 80 years later, but there are many scenes where it appears not (?). does she said then? does the camera is omniscient? ... apparently, cameron did not care and as it suits. was entitled to a careful reconstruction of the boat, even in details (fabrics used at the time, etc..), while the characters are historically not very credible ; class struggle rather agreed that boils down to "the rich are bastards uneducated and the poor have fun," everything is a tissue of cliches, the rich avant-garde rebel, poor talented with his carpe diem junk the bad guy pretending possessive and resentful. similarly, we see the poor rose, who laments near other rich women who chat things trivial. but the poor are all poets and philosophers? for cons, the scenes where the boat started sinking are the real success of the film, although the special effects are flawless. between disaster movie, pageant approximate, and the love story takes to the trifle teenager, titanic is still leaves a pleasant look, but do not be demanding on the form and substance, and especially to accept that the film's star, not the boat is the couple rose and jack.
