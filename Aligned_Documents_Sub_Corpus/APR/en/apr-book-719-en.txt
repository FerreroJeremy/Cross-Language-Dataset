baverez is an illusionist. the characteristic of these artists is to make you believe what they want you to think through subtle effects sleeves, hand games, brought here by the powder figures. take a number and place in a context which does is not his, is known to every magician. baverez wants to fly? he is the gadfly who believes the advance team, but is, at best, nothing (thank you to la fontaine). if it is true that france is more radiant great nation of louis xiv ( the king died and his age as 18 °), i oppose the idea that it would mean that a small nation with no ambition greater than that of grocery supermarkets. this reminds me lament another painful collaboration. if the average growth in france since 1990 the situ (on the date of publication of this book) to "25 ° position on the thirty countries that account outlook", it is necessary to add, as does denis clerc in "alternatives economiques" no. 219, december 2003 - to summarize the quantitative analysis - between 1997 and 2002 included the cumulative economic growth of france is stronger than average (14.6% against 12.9% for oecd, 12.2% for the eu and 12.9% for the united kingdom). supposedly shunned by foreign capital (p. 79), france was in 2002, the second global destination for direct investment abroad. its productive investments fell 1.7% between end 2001 and second quarter of 2003, not 13% as stated on page 60. the creation of businesses has not declined "of 2% per annum since the late 80s (p. 74) but increased from 184,000 in 1985 (insee première n ° 159, september 1991) to 178,000 in 2002 ( quick insee, 17 jan 2003) a net decrease of 3% over the period. the french economy would crumble under the weight of which baverez officials estimated the number to "5.1 million in 2003 against 4 million in 1980 (p .17): the report of the employment observatory counted 3.755 million public officials serving in the state civil service, territorial and hospital. if the average pay of civil servants is higher than the private sector, c this is because functions are aimed more at busy executives in the private 48.8% of total employment against 16.1%. the salaries of senior civil servants is lower than fourth in the private market. our system "social-statist" ruin the country with the 35 hours that constrain productivity growth to level off around 1.1% "(p.38, p.45 statements occasions, 69 and 117). according to the note of trends in the insee (june 2003), the increase in hourly labor productivity in manufacturing rose from 0.79% per quarter between 1992 and 1996 to 1.24% per quarter, 1997 to 2002, and per capita, due to the decline in working hours, from 0.74% to 0.98%. the manipulation of figures by baverez has no other aim than to kill the role of regulator economic state, any claim to his intervention, following the liberal doctrine is false, because it is again necessary to remember that without the state, the market would not exist (see). in addition to the economic news shows that we need for intervention for banks, the automobile industry for example. denials rained on the shell baverez pursuing his merry way as if the liberal absolutely nothing affected him.
