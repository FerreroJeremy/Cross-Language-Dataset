i was very disappointed by this book but looked super good from the summary that could be read back: adventure, investigation, love relationships ... all in turkey in an era rarely addressed by the authors: the average age ... ca short looked very tempting ... and then it starts really well, a murder story without anyone really know the murdered and the murderer, each chapter leaves the floor to someone or something different ( it's really amazing and fun), a love story ... but not really accomplished after 100 pages i really started to get stalled because history, it does not happen much, it very descriptive and too much on the details of everyday life of different characters, although the plot does not progress ... in the end i gave up after 200 pages telling me that i will not have courage to go after the 400 or 500 pages remaining at this pace is false, i am very disappointed because i actually thought about finding a style similar to "save ispahan" or "the abyssinian" by ruffin, or "the nabob "by irene frain but this time no luck :-(
