i am not a fan of little brown bear, but i had bought several before i knew it. the pages scroll with little brown bear who put their hearts delight on the walls though insisting on the joy felt (er. .. as a parent, i felt obliged to add comments to each page stating that pob although it was great, it was a mistake) and finished with a brilliant denouement: the spanking. apparently, the only acceptable method of education to our friends the bears. he has also had to change the end: there for me many other ways to punish a child! avoid it!
