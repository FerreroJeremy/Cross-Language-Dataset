the music. or the story of one of the most overestimated in recent years ... when in 2001 the british press began to catch fire on what she called "new rock revolution", she soon realized that it was performed outside of his land. white stripes, strokes (usa) hives (sweden), vines (australia) complexes of english in a lot of heroes who have since dubbed the 1st group came ... which proved to be the music, leeds band in the tradition of mancunian scene of the late 80s (primal scream, stone roses), which reads the first album and waited necessarily disappointing. the nasal voice irritates robert harvey in the first place. production filled echo - hide misery to hide the weakness of the group - makes this album difficult to bear. worse yet, all the songs are copied from the same model (of the hit singles "the people" and "take the long way and walk it") so quickly that the impression of repetition. the recipe is simple: riff guitar intro (and looped throughout the song) and then came the voice with no real melody, arrival of the bass and cymbals and the entire battery (with lots of echo) and chorus and over again ... how boring!
