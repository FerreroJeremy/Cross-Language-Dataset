for my part i think the pictures are of rare beauty, the characters endearing super successful and we do not know the reality or stops and starts or cartoon. i watch the dvd several times to capture all the beauty and complexity of images. deja scene with the introduction i knew i would take the full view, in my opinion this film animation far exceeds the quality already more than satisfactory toy story. i found the story touching, full of suspense, a great soundtrack that will shake your furniture if you have a home cinema. bonuses (on 2 dvds) are at the height of the film itself that i have loved them, they are numerous and full hyper notament regarding testing and animation storyboard is perhaps even too much but fans and movie buffs like me will delight for sure. i think it's a dvd collector has absolutely possess. whether you love disney or not, it's great art and it's great disney.
