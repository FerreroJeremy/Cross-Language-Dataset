it's been few months that i am passionate about the history of france under napoleon and i consume documentary documentary, book after book ... but there ... apart from a complete libretto (but full of mistakes in french, probably translated from czech in a hurry), one can say that this cabinet has an interest. i regret to say no. the sequences linger on shots of the palace that napoleon and his army had occupied on the road to vienna and brno (brno at the time) and a narrator dressed in veteran who reads his teleprompter. and come to three quarters of the documentary, now that explains the strategy of napoleon ... conclusion, i will assume my mistake and keep the box (because that book as a bag of soil from austerlitz? will d agreement ...) but did not make my mistake!
