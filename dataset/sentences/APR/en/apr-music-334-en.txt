if you're a hardcore fan of "king of pop" and you do not already have this disc, then buy it.
if you are curious or just a lover of good music, you hasten to look elsewhere!
this is truly an album of poor quality releases at a time when the discs were produced every three months ...
only the title "ben" might just touch our listening but the rest is really futile.
