after watching the drama "les choristes" by christophe barratier, i wanted to see him again.
the original version was released in theaters in france march 17, 2004.
but mathieu is another case: he founded a choir so that students are happier and have more authority.
i do not know the director christophe barratier is why i was so surprised - i found a new favorite director!
the actors could not be better: gerard jugnot looks nice but a bit harsh and then it is excellent in the role of clement mathieu, who is more empathetic than other teachers.
the character of the director rachin, for example, can be well played by franc!
ois berléand because it seems to be very wicked and autorisétaire like other teachers too.
all the boys are good players too: pépinot is played by a little boy very cute and what is the role ...
the image, sets, editing and dialogue are wonderful.
technicians, designers and other participants have done a good job.
the most important thing in this film and music.
the soundtrack is great - thanks to bruno coulais and christophe barratier who made it.
the melodies are consistent with the atmosphere and with the sentiments in this internship - loneliness, sadness and hatred.
hearing the music is becoming thoughtful and somewhat melancholy.
thank you to philippe lopes-curval, writer!
after seeing the film one must reflect on the period after the second world war, which deals with the history.
in summary i can say that this film is perfect.
i could always see him again because of music, and actors in general because of the very dramatic story.
thank you to everyone who helped make this movie great!
