after one last album not exactly revolutionary, was expected to turn placebo.
placebo, led by brian molko androgynous idol of the young ladies seemed to stand still for a few years, being confined to stay in this recipe makes a pop energetically very accessible.
but now, by dint of turning, mayonnaise finally have a questionable taste.
sleeping with ghosts far included some good titles, as much meds is provided.
the anecdote is the keynote of this new album very disappointing.
the ultra-fans may appreciate but others, go your way.
you turn instead to the first album, much more convincing.
