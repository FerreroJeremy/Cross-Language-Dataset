i ran on "black cherry" right out - hoping to regain the magic of "felt mountain" (album mythical, fascinating, where nothing is disposable).
but i should have known there was something rotten in the kingdom of navarre (in this case, goldfrapp) after realizing that goldfrapp had sold some music of felt mountain to the pub, which is a nothing disappointing.
no risk of this happening to one: the album is sorely lacking inspiration.
the group wanted to renew and go to electro, but without adding a new element (it blondie what year already? 1982?
and donna summer? 1974, no?).
on most tracks, the sound is rough - not "dancing" - allison goldfrapp and simpering.
the single "train" is a horror.
only a few songs, listen to without displeasure (hairy trees, forever and above, deep honey).
that said, do not expect you to your maximum personal cd by transferring all the dross: like most discs from emi, the album is "copy protected" - which also means that your computer or your car does will read it.
in short: left to buy an album by goldfrapp, buy as many "felt mountain".
