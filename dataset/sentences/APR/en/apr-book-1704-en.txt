a very good book, little comment except for a short but interesting preface.
many reproductions (all are not) watercolors that turner said during his two trips to venice.
perfect mastery of color, beautiful landscapes, detailed drawings more or less depending on the subject, not a false note, but it could be different from a great english painter and forerunner of impressionism.
