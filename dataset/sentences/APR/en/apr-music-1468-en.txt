this is an album energetic, thoughtful, aligning rhythms effective, varied, slightly acid, placed between pop and folk.
after the heady opening title, the style changes radically with "barnacle goose" and spurts machine guns, a "hummingbird" refreshing and spontaneous breath a fresh air of spring, and so on ...
in short, with great economy means but a joyous energy that shows the joy of playing together, born ruffians sign a very successful album, securities short, so short ...
but so good.
