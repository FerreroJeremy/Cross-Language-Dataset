the sentence following the hit "1982" miss kittin &amp; the hacker () is perfectly suited to the situation.
yuksek is the big hype of the moment in the french electro (recently couv two mags specialized "trax" and "tsugi").
yuksek is a young producer who reims with some other (sebastian, brodinski, minitel rose ...) is in keeping with the "french touch 2.0".
a second wave "french touch" that a dozen years after its glorious elder (daft punk, cassius, etienne de crecy ...), triumph also for export, from london to sydney via los angeles and tokyo.
we can rejoice that the french electro succeeds where rock failed: exit successfully hexagonal borders.
but the problem is that this yuksek (and his cronies above, behind which is often found pedro winter, producer of daft punk.
now you see me?) only in the footsteps of justice, vitalic or jackson &amp; his computer band, who themselves walked on those of daft punk (therefore) or miss kittin &amp; the hacker (voila, i completed my loop:)).

technically, everything is there but lack the essentials: innovation and artistry).
but what will he in two or three years?
will remember it does, does qualify is this disc innovative or important (as can be said of most artists he goes and that i quoted)?
