in his 1000 or so pages unparagraphed, littell draws a picture, which defies credibility, of a fictional ss-man who is evil personified.
the caricature is so gross that it exonerates the average unexceptional ss-man, making him seem less bad by comparison.
i assume this was not littell's intent.
fortunately and whatever its 'readers' may say, the book is unreadable.
