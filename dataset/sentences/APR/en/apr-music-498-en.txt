"the power to believe," last studio album from king crimson to date, shows a training summit of his art.
the disc is a perfect success between innovation and respect for the glorious past of the group.
after the series "project" in which rober fripp experimenting structures of variable geometry, king crimson returns to the classic quartet format.
the compositions are strong, emit an enormous power and its overall supply cohesion and compactness.
somewhat in the spirit of classic crimson fripp / wetton / cross / bruforfd.
where music at very high energy that finds its full impact.
even if there is more room for improvisation and pure experimentation.
one of the most successful of all the fripp / belew / gunn / mastelotto.
