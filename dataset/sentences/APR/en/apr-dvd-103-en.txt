i have just finished watching season 2 and this time i will try to follow the 3rd one on tv ...
the second season is even more acid than the 1st and full of the usual intricate secret and blackmails and feminine humor and gossip.
i think marc cherry understands the feminine world very well.
i think we all know at least one person or even ourselves could be a character hysteria lane from time to time.
great set of dvds ... 24 episodes + bonus material totaly worth it
