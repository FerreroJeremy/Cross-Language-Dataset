the passion for ecology pascal obispo is more to prove because he knows how to recycle good songs to make them dull and insipid songs, an example his song lucia is a pumping theme song piano wasted time the album hotel california eagles (just listen to from one minute to convince himself 20) the same formula is applied on this new album, "idealist" is a pumping rule of manu chao! "flag" is pumped on viva la vida by coldplay.
the rest of the album is always the same materials that constantly recycles obispo on each new album, making it an environmentalist outstanding:-melodies uninteresting - string arrangements to cry laughing when you listen to the songs of the early polnareff.
yes i do not like the music of this setter of french music that dares to say am-quality, and it bothers me greatly that he sells as many real artists who compose and create beautiful albums like bob little, art mengo, hubert - fredericks goldman jones, emily loizeau, gérard manset (his latest album is a marvel as the last of william sheller is one of the most beautiful album of french songs that i heard recently) and also sell little but as these artists are not marketing and do not go on the radio, they are just media.
