this cd is my taste using a cd for abitudes we gave 2 pac!
he possesses very good cons of legendary titles such as "ghetto gospel", "thugs get lonely too" and "thug 4 life".
produced by eminem, this album is far from "good sound" that gave us 2 pac on other albums such as "2 pacalypse now" and "until the end of time".
while disappointing, this album will delight fans of eminem.
