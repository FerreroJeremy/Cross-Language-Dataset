"the wall" a grandiose, exaggerated, pink floydien to wish on the site of berlin.
even if this is not the best live performance of roger waters, this is a fantastic time to watch again and again thanks to this dvd.
one bonus discovered thanks to a few anecdotes from behind "the wall" reported by some protagonists of this event, including roger waters and gerald scarfe among others.
a dvd to own absolutely for fans of the first as the last time roger waters and pink floyd.
