indeed on this cd, the sound has been digitally remastered (in reality denatured) to get closer to the sounds of eliminator.
the result is catastrophic because it transformed a boogie-rock album for clear, clean and precise sound insipid porridge.
buy the remastered version of the album released in 2006 by rhino records (ref: b000ccd0hq): it has the original and there is only happiness!
