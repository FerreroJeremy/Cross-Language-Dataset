after esp (1965), after miles smiles (1966) and sorcerer (1967) and a series of special concerts this year (in 1967, are the unreleased concert in antwerp, october 28, paris, november 06 , munich on 08 november), miles sign one of the finest studio recordings that are in the history of jazz.
with nefertiti, miles clot his career with the acoustic group, its second major quintet, and what dazzling quintet!
wayne shorter and incredible mystical composer / pianist herbie hancock engineering inhabited by rachmaninov / talented bassist ron carter and tony williams, the great tony williams, a young prodigy who has received instruction from alan dawson, superlative drummer.
it is enough to convince them to listen to the first theme, "nefertiti", where the battery is almost unprecedented role in jazz.
on a haunting theme for seven minutes of happiness, the musicians play the rhythm section, drummer and solo part!!
or the departure of "madness", a flying start reminiscent of super cars, the v 12 and other ferrarri!
we pass the 5th in no time ...
comparison may be somewhat misplaced, but what cylinder still ...
pity that this quintet has not lasted longer ....
many will regret, but forget that with miles, there is no static career ...
ps: little bonus "superlative" and not least, tks alternates of "madness" (a piece of "madness" with pepper sauce, chili made by the super-extra-brilliant fire tony williams, who died in 1997) another pinocchio (shorter component) i bet you that the theme will long remain etched in your memory ...
and two alternates to hand jive, subject all fire-and flame.
