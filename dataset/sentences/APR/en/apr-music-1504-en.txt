for many, this first album by the pharcyde is a classic for many reasons: firstly this group straight out of la has a style unique to himself away from the trends del'epoque and westcoast gangsta rap by dr.
dre and all his cronies!
the pharcyde, themselves, do not promote violence, instead, a comic style as can be heard on the track "yo mama" or each group member's mother valve on the other but also more love with the song "passin 'me by" was sampled many times.
other songs are legendary, such as "i'm that type of nigga" breathtaking, or "pack the pipe" a short album with an incomparable atmosphere, titles and subjects to different beats!
a rare piece has to acquire faster!
