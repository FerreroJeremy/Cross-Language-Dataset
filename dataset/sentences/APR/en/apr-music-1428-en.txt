i am not convinced that most people who appreciate this album are aware of change of season, sfam, or liquid tension experiment.
the twist is that dream theater is somewhat disturbing: six degrees of inner turbulence is capable of the best (the test that stumped them all) and the worst the glass prison (music for teenagers who seek between aggressive pantera riffs and licks showing off a little inspired timo tolkki).
while we can not accuse the group not to renew, but for students of the berklee college of music and julliard, the point is rather thin and solos, almost non-existent, not at all height previous albums.
the first disc is now trash-metal to metallica, sometimes marshmallow (disappear, misunderstood), with some touches of effects on the voices for "fashionable" in the great debate.
in short, only the second disc is interesting because it provides interesting topics, but we can expect better from such musicians
