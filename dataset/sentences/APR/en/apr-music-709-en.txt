a very good album for those who dislike the music, but those who like to buy a disk pierced in its center in a box under plastic, with a nice gold sticker on it (i think that it is the latter that pleases above).
we can still note the technical prowess of sandrine kiberlain, who succeeded against all odds to sing more false than jane birkin.
but of course the sheep will be very happy to have a beautiful object that will allow them to discuss among friends about what they read in telerama, the world of music ...
that is to say that a journalist has written ...
an album firmly rooted in the xxi century consumer society + media tyranny bravo l'artiste!
ps: when will they replace the copy control by a trash control to prevent this kind of sound waste??
