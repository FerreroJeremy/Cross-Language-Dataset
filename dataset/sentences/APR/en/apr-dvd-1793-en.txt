the 2 stars all say at once, it only (and god knows why) because this movie was definitely a film of a generation (the 80s).
without doubt, in the turmoil that shook this time (and today), i called the crisis, young-they aspired to be calm and serenity.
but apart from that what about this movie.
the images are pretty good it's true but what's that long.
writ of beautiful postcards for the eyes and eventually you knock out of sleep.
