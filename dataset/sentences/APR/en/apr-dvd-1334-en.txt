after the series of concerts at the olympia, sheila we propose for the first time a live dvd ...
pending is the height of the result as the recording is superb!
the detail that makes the difference is to propose a "before" and "after" the show which then becomes more than just live but rather a movie musical.
as a bonus, a one-hour interview is proposed, a time that passes too quickly and sheila during which only confirms that it is a human singer, in which sincerity is genuine.
finally, i would say that if you're still to believe that sheila is wearing braids and sing the school is finished, take a look at this concert, you'll be pleasantly surprised (e)!
