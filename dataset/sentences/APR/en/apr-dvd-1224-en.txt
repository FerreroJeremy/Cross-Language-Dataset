a note which does not apply to the work nor the video quality of this edition.
but it happens that the 59 original episodes, only about 2 / 3 are presented on this 4 dvd box set.
indeed, it is titled "volume 1", not "season 1", it is still a lamentable practice.
therefore remains to be hoped that the supplement is published in the near future, and that seasons 2 and 3 do not suffer in turn this abuse ...
