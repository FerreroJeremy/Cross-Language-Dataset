the abc is perhaps the book's most affordable fabrice midal, a specialist in tibetan buddhism.
one of the works to advise someone who wants to clear the ground and see more clear on that tradition.
all words and important concepts are explained simply.
the form is quite playful, with a large number of questions that anyone can arise, which the author proposes an answer to both traditional and modern, accessible to westerners the twenty-first century.
also i found the photos that open each chapter very beautiful.
a first reading or a book easy to give your parents who wonder what buddhism!
