very disappointed by this book, however well written, but i found it very long, tedious, with a real and palpable nostalgia that eventually annoy me.
i have not found any yet (except thomas) a little gay, but a lot of resentment ...
i usually caught me by my reading, which has absolutely not been the case, i must confess that i walked more and less i wanted to continue ...
