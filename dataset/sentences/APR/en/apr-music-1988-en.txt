ryuichi sakamoto, pianist and composer atypical desire has often been neighborly in his artworks strokes of genius and faults of taste.
most of his albums (except maybe masterstrokes casa, 1996 and back to the basics), are often uneven and bewildering patchwork, cross pop and symphonic music experimental electronic and treatment of purifies piano, which nevertheless always arouse the curiosity or the love unconditional.
beauty, or discord smoochy are few.
but alas, in this sweet revenge, sakamoto bogged time an entire album in a soup pop / house / r 'n b very indigestible.
the cover speaks volumes (the giant boa ...) and audio content is in keeping.
after a sticker experimental plot as an opening ( "tokyo story"), hopefully good things but the first pieces struggling to attract sustainable and do not stand a handful of plays: "moving on" which announces the color (kitsch) on the instrumental menagerie deployed (keyboards, marshmallow and drum machines to honor) and "sentimental" song nasal and repetitive.
a wake r'n b more energetic ( "regret") attempts to redress the balance, but how not to tire quickly of a refrain as bland and ultimately annoying?
from "pounding at my heart" and then "love and hate" (which would be its effect in a nightclub in tokyo-depressive insomniacs) is shipwreck.
uncle ryuichi unpacks not softened the tracks without any relief, invariable format (four to five minutes), bringing guests to execution-singers.
it must be said that the text, worthy of a schoolboy's diary, do not grow in voice performance.
only the short and sexy "7 seconds" (with bass clarinet on a ghostly groove effective) can escape briefly this hard-poppy, including the robotics aspect is not redeemed by the electronic sounds-like jets of steam (so fair) ...
in short, an album dispensable except for the hardcore fans (or very indulgent) of the elusive sakamoto, definitely capable of the best and the worst!
