images superb scenery unconventional compared to the genre.
in short, a western that does not sacrifice too many cliches of the genre, except of course the grand final reckoning ...
the sound is superb, with a good home cinema you inside the action.
costner sign a good western, one that we expect from the great clint's unforgiven.
duvall is excellent as usual, and it shows in the art.
the shots are successful and the scenario is worth pursuing.
