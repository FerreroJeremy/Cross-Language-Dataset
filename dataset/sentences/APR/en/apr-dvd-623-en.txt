i am still stunned by what i just saw.
will i have the strength to speak?
this sunday afternoon i attended with my little family in a moment of pure cinematic stigmatization.
after "between vu" the "bronzes 3" i really thought that french cinema had hit bottom, i was wrong! "asterix at the olympic games" is indeed as favorite for the title of the film more nil century!
i am a fan of comics since my youngest age, i wonder how albert uderzo and goscinny family could endorse such an insult to their characters!
infidel, this film has very little to do with the album.
it is simply a massacre there powerless to cascades gags all too suspicious of each other, a game player grotesque, ridiculous (low delon!) and a surfeit of special effects to give you migraine.
heroes asterix and obelix are erased and almost nonexistent in this opus dedicated entirely to the exploits of the traitor brutus, the son of julius caesar, also the film should have frankly called "brutus olympics" so the presence screen benedict poolvoorde is ubiquitous and obvious.
unfortunately the belgian actor wants to do too much and quickly becomes tiresome.
one positive point though: the role of clovis cornillac much more friendly and jovial in the skin of the little gallic warrior that unbearable christian clavier.
as for mr alain delon and gérard depardieu, they are a mere shadow of themselves!
loans to ridicule in a shameless nanar in exchange for a large seal to ensure their old age ...
lamentable, distressing are the right words to describe this turnip is indigestible to prohibit any library.
comedians, pipole, athletes are in a final orgy, real ode to human folly.
one thing is certain, asterix at the olympic games gave me the proof that a camera can do much damage a firearm.
thomas langmann is a dangerous man for the french cinema.
