it was long-awaited acoustic album and we are not disappointed.
indeed, what happiness!
nice varied selection that illuminates the multiple talents and versatility of rory.
and how we miss him!
exactly as i remember him in concert.
the video from 1989 in cork is also good but how to say "painful" to watch because i can not help but feel nervous, impatient and a little sad.
however, it appears happy to see (as was the case every year, its audience in the city.
but of course, performance is fantastic, as always.
