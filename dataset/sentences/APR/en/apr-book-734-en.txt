i have greatly enjoyed the first 6 tales of san francisco, but it is separate.
the atmosphere of san francisco is always pleasant and shifted and we appreciate the return of characters.
but the tone "gay porn" rather sordid, and the narrative in first person does not do justice to the lightness and optimism that had emerged in earlier volumes.
the plot is unoriginal and somewhat militant: it is closer to section gay activist in america republican george bush that the sociological drama funny.
dommage, armistead maupin would know to stop, but he has no likely to pay taxes like everyone else.
