but in real life, anthony is a gay icon and incidentally a great singer whose voice, plaintive and original in its tone recalls the singer of erasure (want want ...).
his songs are wonderful and poignant ballads or maudlin piano is the main instrument, sometimes accompanied by sweet violins or trumpets sullen.
coté, antony knows the crème de la crème new york: lou reed (yes) just put his voice rugueues early "first full of love," singer boy george in luxury "for today im a boy," rufus wrainwright on "man is a baby" (whose music it is close) and "spiraling" with denevdra banhart (fellow label), what i love is that all the guests fall under austere songs which gives the disc a nice unit.
there is even a quote from marc almond (whose music is very close) to the following credits.
if you like the singers mentioned above, the great (pop) and orchestral music you love surround you sometimes melancholic atmosphere, i recommend this wonderful disc.
