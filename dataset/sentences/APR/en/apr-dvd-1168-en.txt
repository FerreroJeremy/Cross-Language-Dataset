top gun well everyone knows this is the absolute must film for both boys (with the aircraft and all) and girls (with romance).
why this collector's edition rather than a simple editing less dear to me you say?
well here because frankly it's worth it: the making of hyper-extends the full pleasure and some fun bonus rather are very nice.
i am rather against the collector versions thinking that makes us pay the superfluous i've been convinced and i do not regret it!
