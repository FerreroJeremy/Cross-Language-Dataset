because it should not be fooled, we are not witnessing yet another return of the group was dying yes the who and others who are committed in pitiful show nostalgia for retirement.
because genesis has let a indelible mark in music history (with pink floyd) for nearly 40 years.
because little group together several generations of fans (i saw 3 different concerts at the parc des princes).
for all these reasons this is the live "ear shot" so this cd the entire show given at the last tour group.
a setlist which is reminiscent of the legendary pink floyd pulse:-a mix of older tracks (behind the lines, ripples, los back or my favorite the carpet crawlers) and the most recent period of collins ( more than 15 years, forgetting the titles of the harrowing experience without collins). - an interpretation certainly more laid (the game is a bit slower than on the album) but always fair, the solos are played perfectly.
thus, the viewer stands before a group of friendly audiences preferring to return the best of his art despite the weight of years.
it is in the interpretation "demo" but in the pleasure of hearing in the proper sense.
for those who did not, i recommend the dvd to appear with such a strong point i know what i like to visual retracing career entire group and (i repeat) the carpet crawlers which ended 2h30 show in softness and emotion ...
