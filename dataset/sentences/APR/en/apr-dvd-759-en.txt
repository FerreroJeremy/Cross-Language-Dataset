staggering, totally stupid, with gags see very heavy fat!
no subtlety in this film despite the beautiful thandie newton totally anachronistic in this series of grotesque situations.
umpteenth story orphanage coveted by powerful well muscled bad, except that it occupies asian is other than eddie murphy, donning three roles in this film whose main character "norbit" which is nothing compared to the composition of the character "raspoutia" delightful young woman over 120kg.
the film could have been better if a real actress round had assumed the role of the shrew obese, but how to laugh freely of the gene for a person suffering from overweight?
then a man dressed up with more offense, but the composition of eddie murphy is too exuberant, too heavy and it is impossible to attach to the wealthy person without personality.
there was also the moralizing about marriage just sealing the 'atmosphere, even if it leaves a pimp be the prerogative of condoms in a church, breathlessnessand between the few good gags.
i remain with a mixed opinion, shared by the weary and afflicted of all but seduced by a few strokes of humor frankly hilarious!
this dvd is often at an attractive price, it's not worth more, to use in case of total depression, but frankly it is a little disappointed to be given to fans of eddie murphy preference.
