rather than playing in the facility again an album modeled on the precedent, slipknot with their third album reinvents itself while retaining the recipe for success.
songs like "blister exists", "three nil" or "pulse of the maggots" or the new single "duality" is the purest vein of what the group can do.
others, like "prelude3.0", "circle", "vermillion pt2" take the listener the wrong hair because we are dealing here with real acoustic ballads, a sign of envy for slipknot to grow and become a true band and not just a bulldozer.
the shadow of stonesour remembers quite often in our ears when these few acoustic songs and singing from corey taylor to the point that one wonders how he will manage the sustainability of these two formations.
another small point for this remarkable album are some of the minis solis slayer scattered in some pieces here and also provide a good surprise for the listener.
rubin's production is really excellent and allows to distinguish all the instruments which is a real pleasure.
this album starts to feel the maturity for the gang of nine even though it is still a little too far: some pieces are too rough, like a series of riffs without true relations, and the album sometimes lacks cohesion.
despite this risk-taking is real there and welcome as it is on this album is going to disappoint many.
for my part, after several plays, i began to really appreciate it.
the subliminal verses album is the smartest of the nine hidden.
now decide for yourself if you're willing to follow them.
