after the sublime jupiter and the very good tides of tomorrow ep, which foreshadowed in cave in a good career in the air and energetic rock, they have one major (rca does not mention) looks more and more of them .
what happened in the studio?
pressure from record label?
we will never know but the antenna album coming out in 2003 is rather frightened most of the songs are either syrupy melodies for youth in need of recognition or pseudo pieces edgy and rebellious.
only two or three tracks stand out as inspire or rubber and glue.
what is missing most from jupiter, especially the lack of inventiveness in pieces, which are mostly flat and predictable, but especially the famous cave in its compounds in air saturated guitars and very sophisticated.
finally there, accidents happen along the way, many artists have had traversed the desert more or less long, and ultimately important is whether land on his feet!
