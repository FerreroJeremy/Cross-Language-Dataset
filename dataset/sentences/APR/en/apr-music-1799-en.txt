the great return of 4 horsemen after the failure of st anger, plagiarize neo metal full wave is just not easy guys!
and yeah we wanted to make a profit damage is pathetic and missed, then suddenly turning the jacket is left for a big palot the trash, the problem is that far from the super and justice or ride.
hetfield has lost his voice, the songs are too long with lots of solos dispensable, we get bored after 3 songs, it turns into a demonstration, it is downright boring.
these guys have become layers in recent years, concluded: album and group interest without forget, i prefer to listen the last kreator.
