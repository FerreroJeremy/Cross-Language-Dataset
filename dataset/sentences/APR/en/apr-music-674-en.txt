really, i chronicler of this cd and ac has not been easy, because i have the time to listen more ...
besides the fact that i see is music for teenagers and it's not my favorite genre, i hate the political side of this album: while they hate chirac sarko and they are evenings in schools trade ...
whether for or against c no pbm, he just must be logical ...
so i put a star just for the song is an insult to the english but that is laughable given the emphasis (daing eulone ...)
