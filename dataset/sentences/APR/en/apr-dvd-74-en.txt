the first impression is not to watch a james bond ....
nostalgic of the "james bond tradition" period sean connery, go your way.
here we have more to do with a superhero, a clone of batman, jason bourne and superman.
at any moment we expected to see the bad guys out of kryptonite.
yamakasi scene (is it a film produced by luc besson?).
in the next film will be the one they slamer ptit coup.
all the ingredients are there to please a young audience.
the writers do not get bored, creating a "james bond origins" in the mid-2000s.
no problem doing a clean sweep of the past.
that said, i decided to give 2 stars to this movie.
first, because the film is far superior to bonds last 25 years (rather difficult challenge i admit).
then as the film leaves look pleasant, provided we do not expect to watch a james bond.
yes thank you ...
