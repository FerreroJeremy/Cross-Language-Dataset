since their inception, the bearded trio we had used to a good blues album.
after an excellent "deguello", came out a year top, zz top gives us a "el loco".
it starts with "tube snake boogie" with his track traffiquée his percussion and guitar that sound too bright (it is a good way).
but the rest is more doubtful with "i want to drive you home" or "heaven, hell or houston.
basically if you are a fan of the band's early work as " tres hombres, "" first album "fadengo!", "rio grande mudd" ...
