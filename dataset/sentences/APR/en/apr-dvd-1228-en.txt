a super nanar, poorly played, staged as a parody of itself, with a sense of rhythm that would not have denied the inspector derrick, no sympathetic character, no interaction between characters who seem to be frozen and expressionless (special the principal actor).
nothing saves this movie from boredom and often consternation.
a discouraged even if you have 1:40 to spare!
