excellent album, really good sound.
but please note: notice the logo copy-protection!
this logo means that you can not copy this cd (either mp3, wma, ogg, aac or other), even though you bought it legally.
consequence: you can not possibly read all your cd drives, including your car, and you can not copy it to your usb key, or else your ipod, your pc ...
in short, it's still distressing to pay for a product that can not really have.
this album is excellent, but think carefully about this before buying ...
