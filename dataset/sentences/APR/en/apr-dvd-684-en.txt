the film is not bad in itself, i have nothing to repprocher actors or the script.
the trailer for the film leaves imply that there are several scenes of large scale battles.
there is only one real battle towards the end of the film, and it sees a piece.
if you want to see "the life of genghis khan, this movie is for you.
if you want a film in the tradition of "braveheart" or "the 13th warrior", go your way ...
