well, even if my comment will be swamped by other praise, even when i add my grain of salt.
although undisciplined player (i am unable to finish a book without being taped ..) i have to confess under the charm of this novel.
it's intelligent without being learned, is informative but never boring, and it's a real blast elsewhere.
this book is both a dive in history, and a ticket simple evasion.
