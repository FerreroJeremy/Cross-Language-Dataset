what more of a book that said everything was on its particular scenario dante whose common thread is never lost on the way, a perfect expression of the author literally plunging into the adventure, the many twists, on points akme frequent, the intelligent processing of manichaeism (far from a christian proselytizing as some critics have made), and finally on the charisma of its characters (aragorn, gandalf, etc. ...).
to tell you the truth, i literally cried at the end of the book as the immersion was great, it's very simple: we would never leave this great "middle earth"!
and when we realize that we will have after the "lord of the rings" attack two books almost as master lectures: "the hobbit" and "the silmarillion" is simply the joy of discovering more about this amazing world!
forget the insipid harry potter, or even werber, and therefore penetrates open up a world in which you likely do not come out unscathed!
