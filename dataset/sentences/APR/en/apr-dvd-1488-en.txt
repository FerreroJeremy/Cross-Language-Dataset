i must confess that i much preferred the book by jane austen adaption but his film is still very convincing.
with matthew macfadyen i do not know and who i was particularly charmed!
also the scenery (not done everything i had imagined but the filmmaker can not succeed in bridging the imagination of everyone:) and music are gorgeous.
a superb set of actors, i think falling in love with this film:)
