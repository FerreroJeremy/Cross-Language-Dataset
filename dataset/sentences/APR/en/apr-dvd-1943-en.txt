this album is the companion of a television show of streisand in the 70s, should never have been published.
it is true that the idea to orchestrate the songs of barbra in different styles (african, spanish, japanese) is basically a good idea.
but alas, if the tv show is a visual success, the album when it was almost unbearable.
barbra although not very vocally to form a hard time being heard among the noise of washing machines, vacuum cleaners, telephones that accompany certain songs.
for the show deserves cons (him) to be seen!
