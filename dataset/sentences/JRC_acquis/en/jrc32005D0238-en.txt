2005/238/: Commission Decision of 14 July 2004 concerning aid granted to the fisheries and aquaculture sector in Corsica from 1986 to 1999 (notified under document number C(2004) 2585)Text with EEA relevance Commission Decision of 14 July 2004 concerning aid granted to the fisheries and aquaculture sector in Corsica from 1986 to 1999 (notified under document number C(2004) 2585) (Only the French text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2005/238/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments in accordance with the above provision, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) A meeting was held in Brussels on 21 May 1996 between France and the Commission concerning the situation of certain economic sectors in Corsica, including the fisheries sector.
The Commission learned during this meeting that public aid had been granted to the sector without it having been notified to permit its examination in accordance with Article 93 (now Article 88) of the Treaty. (2) By letter dated 14 June 1996, the Commission asked France to provide details of this aid. (3) By letter dated 7 July 1996, France informed the Commission that it had asked the authorities in Corsica to forward the information requested.
Since the Commission did not receive this information, a first reminder was sent on 12 September 1996. (4) Subsequently, by letter dated 17 December 1996, France sent certain information concerning the aid in question.
Documentation was sent by letters dated 3 December 1997 and 11 August 1998. (6) The Commission then made a new request for further information by letter dated 11 February 1999.
After a further two reminders, a large part of the information required arrived by letter dated 11 April 2001. (7) In addition, the Commission was informed of Report No 1077 of the French National Assembly drawn up in the name of the Committee of Inquiry into the use of public funds and the management of public services in Corsica [1] (hereinafter referred to as the report of the National Assembly).
The report, published in 1998, describes the aid granted to the fisheries and aquaculture sector in 1997 (see point I.C.1.b of the report). (8) The Commission informed France by letter dated 30 October 2001 of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty against the following aid measures implemented in Corsica: - aid for purchasing new and second-hand vessels for the whole period from 1986 to 1999, - aid for converting and equipping existing vessels during the period from 1 January 1987 to 28 October 1998 where the work carried out resulted in increased engine power. (9) By the same decision, the Commission informed France that it had decided to regard as being compatible with the common market aid for converting and equipping vessels where the work carried out did not result in any increase in the power of the vessel and aid for shore facilities for fishermen. (10) By this decision, the Commission also requested France to provide it with the information necessary for examining the aid for aquaculture. (11) By letter dated 21 December 2001, France submitted comments concerning the aid regarding which the formal investigation procedure had been initiated and provided information on the aid for aquaculture. (12) The decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities [2].
This decision therefore concerns the following four types of aid: - aid for purchasing new vessels during the period from 1986 to 1999, - aid for converting and equipping existing vessels during the period from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998 where the work carried out resulted in increased engine power, - aid for purchasing second-hand vessels for the period from 1986 to 1999, - aid for aquaculture for the period from 1994 to 1999. (14) The aid for the fishing fleet was instituted by the Assembly of Corsica, which, on 29 March 1985, adopted Decision 85/10a "on aid for the modernisation of the fleet".
Accordingly, the limitation applies to aid granted to beneficiaries before 14 June 1986.
The limitation therefore applies, in particular, to aid granted before 14 June 1986 by the Region of Corsica but paid to beneficiaries only in subsequent years, after the eligible investments had actually been made.
Consequently, the Commission takes into account, in the analysis below, aid granted by decisions taken between 14 June 1986 and 31 December 1999.
The subsidy was 20 % of the purchase price, with an additional subsidy of 10 % where it was the first purchase of a new vessel and a further 10 % where the vessel was built in Corsica.
In addition, with the aim of encouraging Corsican shipyards using traditional timber-construction methods, the subsidy could be increased by 20 % of the purchase price with a special contribution from the specific funding available for the promotion of the timber sector.
The subsidy of 5 % where the vessel was timber-built in a Corsican shipyard was also abolished. (21) Decision 97/36 did not make any substantial change to the provisions described above.
It continued to stipulate that the contribution from the shipowner had to be at least 10 %.
Decision 93/25 increased this to 30 % of the cost of the investment. (24) Decision 95/79 did not change the rate of aid but specified that, if the owner of the vessel applied for Community aid, the grant from the Corsican authorities would be calculated in accordance with the aid rates provided for in the relevant Community rules.
Decision 95/79 also laid down that, if the application for aid for converting or equipping a vessel was submitted for the first purchase of a new or second-hand vessel by a fisherman, the first 80 lengths of net could receive a 30 % subsidy.
The purchaser had to contribute at least 15 % of the cost of the vessel. (26) Decision 91/1032 increased the basic rate from 10 % to 15 %.
Decision 95/16 increased the rate to 20 % for vessels less than 20 years old.
Aid for aquaculture (27) Aid for aquaculture was laid down in the 1994 planning agreement between the national and regional governments and in the single programming document for Community aid under Objective 1.
These investments are connected with compliance with health standards and improving the conditions for product marketing: packaging equipment, storage facilities, service vessels, computer equipment, ice-making machines, refrigerated vans, etc. (29) The maximum rate of aid was 25 % of the investment in order to take account of possible financing by the FIFG.
According to point 3.4 of the 2001 Guidelines [4], currently in force, unlawful aid must be examined in the light of the Guidelines applicable when it is granted.
Subsequently, the Guidelines applicable were the following: those published in 1988 [6] for aid granted from 1 January 1989, those published in 1992 [7] for aid granted from 1 July 1992, those published in 1994 [8] for aid granted from 1 January 1995 and those published in 1997 [9] for aid granted from 1 January 1997. (31) The Commission also referred to the successive Council Regulations concerning Community structural measures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector, to which these Guidelines constantly refer, in particular as regards eligible investments and permissible aid rates.
These regulations are as follows: Council Regulation (EEC) No 2908/83 of 4 October 1983 on a common measure for restructuring, modernising and developing the fishing industry and for developing aquaculture [10], Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector [11], Council Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 of 21 December 1993 laying down the criteria and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and the processing and marketing of its products [12] and Council Regulation (EC) No 2468/98 of 3 November 1998 laying down the criteria and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and the processing and marketing of its products [13].
However, France did not achieve the objective set out in MAGP III [14], in force from 1992 to 1996.
It accordingly had to stop granting aid for the construction and modernisation of fishing vessels as from 1 January 1997.
Subsequently, by letter dated 28 October 1998, the Commission told France that it could restart granting investment aid on certain conditions.
In its letter dated 30 October 2001 informing France of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, the Commission assumed that the aid granted from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998 infringed the Guidelines applicable over that period. (34) Secondly, the Commission noted that, given the possible aid rates and the possibility of cumulation with aid under other schemes, the aid had exceeded the maximum permissible rate.
Aid for converting and equipping vessels (35) The Commission expressed doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid granted from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998 for converting and equipping vessels where the work carried out resulted in an increase in the vessel’s engine capacity since, in the same way as for aid for purchasing vessels, aid of this kind did not contribute to achieving the objectives of the MAGP.
In support of its arguments, it enclosed a copy of the Aid Guide drafted by ADEC. (39) France also explained that the age requirements for vessels for the purposes of aid for purchasing second-hand vessels, as laid down in the Guidelines, had been included in the Guide and had been respected. (40) France also forwarded to the Commission, along with its comments following the opening of the formal investigation procedure, information on aid granted for aquaculture required by the "injunction to provide information" contained in the Commission letter dated 30 October 2001.
This aid is, in this respect, therefore compatible with the common market, subject to what is stated below. (44) There remains, however, the problem of aid granted over the period from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998 in view of the obligation on France to stop paying aid for constructing or modernising vessels under the rules of the common fisheries policy, which was lifted by letter dated 28 October 1998 [15].
In its letter dated 30 October 2001 informing France of the opening of the formal investigation procedure, the Commission assumed that aid had been granted during this period.
In total, the applications resulted in aid from the Corsican authorities of more than FRF 13 million, made up of FRF 11,5 million as investment aid and FRF 1,6 million as operating aid.
In 1997, 10 fishing vessels were constructed, …". (46) France made no comment regarding the assumption made in the Commission’s letter dated 30 October 2001, neither stating, for example, that application of Decision 97/36 had been suspended nor that no aid had been granted during the period concerned.
It is therefore safe to assume that aid was actually granted during that period. (47) The successive versions of the Guidelines consistently stipulated that aid for purchasing new vessels was compatible with the common market if it was granted for investments that contributed to achieving the objectives of the MAGP [16].
More specifically, for aid granted from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998, to which the 1997 Guidelines applied, point 2.2.3.1 of those Guidelines laid down that "Aid for the construction of new fishing vessels may be deemed to be compatible with the common market subject to the requirements of Articles 7 and 10 and Annex III (paragraph 1.3) of Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 […]." (48) Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 lays down that "Member States may take such measures to promote the construction of fishing vessels as comply with the global annual intermediate objectives and the final objectives by segment under their multiannual guidance programme within the stated time limits.
By letter dated 28 October 1998, the Commission informed France that "following our meeting of 21 October 1998, our previous meetings and the clarifications contained in your letters dated 5 and 22 October 1998, I have the pleasure to announce that the Directorate-General for Fisheries can accept a resumption of investments such as you envisage, i.e, in a very measured manner, giving priority to young fishermen, without increasing capacity and in compliance with the objectives of the MAGP". (51) It can be seen from this exchange of correspondence that France was perfectly aware that it was not achieving the intermediate objectives of MAGP III and that, despite this, aid for purchasing new vessels was authorised.
The requirements laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 was not therefore fulfilled.
Consequently, under point 2.2.3.1 of the 1997 Guidelines, the aid granted during that period for purchasing new vessels was incompatible with the common market.
Aid for converting and equipping vessels ( 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998) (52) The opening of the formal investigation procedure concerned aids for converting and equipping vessels granted during the period from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998 where the work carried out increased the power of the vessel, because, as in the case of the aid for purchasing new vessels, such aid did not contribute to achieving the objectives of the MAGP. (53) The report of the National Assembly (point I.C.1.b) refers to aid for modernising vessels.
This appears to indicate that aid for modernising vessels could be granted for purchasing a more powerful engine.
In addition, as in the case of aid for purchasing vessels, France made no comment regarding the assumption made in the Commission’s letter dated 30 October 2001 that aid for purchasing an engine more powerful than an existing engine was granted during the period.
It is therefore safe to assume that aid for modernising vessels was actually granted in certain cases where the work carried out resulted in increased engine power. (55) As in the case of aid for construction, point 2.2.3.2 of the 1997 Guidelines stipulates that "Aid for the modernisation of commissioned vessels may be deemed compatible with the common market subject to the requirements of Articles 7 and 10 of, and Annex III (paragraph 1.4) to, Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 [… ]".
Aid for purchasing second-hand vessels (1986-1999) (57) As already indicated in recital 39, France provided information showing that the age requirement had actually been respected.
Aid for aquaculture (1994-1999) (59) In accordance with the successive versions of the Guidelines, aid for aquaculture is compatible with the common market where the requirements laid down in the Regulation on Community structural measures in the fisheries sector are fulfilled. (60) As France indicated in its letter dated 21 December 2001, the Aid Guide took account of those requirements, stipulating in particular that the maximum authorised aid rate must take account of aid from other sources. (61) Accordingly, the aid granted for aquaculture can be deemed to be compatible with the common market.
Article 2 The following aid measures implemented by France in the Region of Corsica and introduced by the Decision of the Assembly of Corsica referred to in Article 1 are compatible with the common market: (a) aid for purchasing new vessels granted outside the period from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998; (b) aid for converting and equipping existing vessels granted outside the period from 1 January 1997 to 28 October 1998 or granted during that period where the work carried out did not result in increased engine power; (c) aid for purchasing second-hand vessels; (d) aid for aquaculture granted from 1994 to 1999.
Interest shall be calculated and applied in accordance with Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 [17].
Article 4 France shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.
