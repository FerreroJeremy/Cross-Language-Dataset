However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use. 6.
The symbol "AD S/Z" or "AD F/M" in Chapters 17 to 19 indicates that the maximum rate of duty consists of an ad valorem duty plus an additional duty for certain forms of sugar or for flour.
Thus, a beverage having an alcohol content by volume of 40 % is to be charged as follows: - "€ 1/% vol/hl" = € 1 × 40, giving a duty of € 40 per hectolitre, or - "€ 1/% vol/hl + € 5/hl" = € 1 × 40 plus € 5, giving a duty of € 45 per hectolitre.

Where the number of substances covered by an INN is less than that covered by the CAS RN, only those substances covered by the INN will be subject to duty-free treatment; (2) where a product of Annex 3 or Annex 6 is identified by a CAS RN corresponding to a specific isomer, only that isomer may qualify for duty-free treatment; (3) double derivatives (salts, esters and hydrates) of INNs identified by a combination of an INN of Annex 3 with a prefix or suffix of Annex 4 qualify for duty-free treatment, provided they are classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheading as the relevant INN: example: alanine methyl ester, hydrochloride; (4) where an INN of Annex 3 is a salt (or an ester), no other salt (or ester) of the acid corresponding to the INN may qualify for duty-free treatment: example: oxprenoate potassium (INN): duty-free oxprenoate sodium: not duty-free.
Customs duty shall be charged at the flat rate of 3,5 % ad valorem on goods: - contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another, or - contained in travellers' personal luggage, provided that such importations are not of a commercial nature.
