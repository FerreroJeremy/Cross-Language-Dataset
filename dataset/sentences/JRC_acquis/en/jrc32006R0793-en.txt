Commission Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 of 12%nbsp%April 2006 laying down certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union Commission Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 of 12 April 2006 laying down certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union [1], and in particular Article 25 thereof, Whereas: (1) In view of the changes introduced by Regulation (EC) 247/2006 and the experience gained, and in the interests of legislative simplification, Commission Regulations (EEC) No 388/92 [2], (EEC) No 2174/92 [3], (EEC) No 2233/92 [4], (EEC) No 2234/92 [5], (EEC) No 2235/92 [6], (EEC) No 2039/93 [7], (EEC) No 2040/93 [8], (EC) No 1418/96 [9], (EC) No 2054/96 [10], (EC) No 20/2002 [11], (EC) No 1195/2002 [12], (EC) No 43/2003 [13], (EC) No 995/2003 [14], (EC) No 14/2004 [15] and (EC) No 188/2005 [16] should be repealed and replaced by a single Regulation laying down rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 247/2006. (2) Detailed implementing rules should be laid down for drawing up and amending the forecast supply balances for products eligible under the specific supply arrangements. (3) Certain agricultural products which are exempt from import duties already require an import licence.
In the interests of administrative simplification, the import licence should be used to support the arrangements for exemption from import duties. (4) A document should also be adopted to support the arrangements for exemption from import duties for other agricultural products which do not require an import licence.
Where appropriate, the Member States should strive to combine the various checks under this Regulation with those provided for under other Community provisions. (22) The minimum number of growers to undergo on-the-spot checks under the various aid schemes should be determined. (23) The sample for the minimum rate of on-the-spot checks should be selected partly on the basis of a risk analysis and partly at random.
The main factors to be taken into consideration for the risk analysis should be specified. (24) Where significant irregularities are found, the rate of on-the-spot checks should be increased during the current and following years in order to attain an acceptable level of assurance that the aid applications concerned are correct. (25) For on-the-spot checks to be effective, it is important for the inspectors to be informed of the reasons for which the growers concerned have been selected for an on-the-spot check.
Such reductions and exclusions should be graded according to the gravity of the irregularity committed and should go as far as the total exclusion from one or more aid schemes for local production for a specified period. (29) As a general rule, reductions and exclusions should not be applied where growers have submitted factually correct information or can otherwise show that they are not at fault. (30) Growers who notify the competent national authorities at any time of incorrect aid applications should not be the subject of reductions or exclusions, irrespective of the reason for the incorrectness, provided the grower concerned has not been informed of the competent authority's intention to carry out an on-the-spot check and provided the authority has not already informed the grower of any irregularity in the application.
The same should apply to incorrect data contained in the computerised database. (31) Where various reductions are to be applied to the same grower, they should be applied independently of each other.
Moreover, the reductions and exclusions provided for in this Regulation should be applied without prejudice to additional penalties under any other provisions of Community or national law. (32) Growers who are unable to fulfil the obligations provided for under the detailed rules for implementing the programmes as a consequence of force majeure or exceptional circumstances should not lose their entitlement to the aid.
It should be specified that it must be possible to adopt these requirements by reference to existing standards under Community rules or, failing these, to international standards, or by reference to traditional methods of cultivation and manufacture. (36) In order to make the best possible use of this specific promotional instrument available to producers and manufacturers of quality products specific to the outermost regions, and in the interests of simplifying management and control and making them more effective, the right to use the graphic symbol should be conferred on operators established in those regions who are directly responsible for the production, packaging for marketing purposes and manufacture of the products concerned and who give an undertaking to fulfil certain obligations. (37) It is the responsibility of the competent authorities in the regions concerned to adopt the additional administrative requirements needed to ensure the correct operation of the mechanisms put in place and to guarantee compliance with those obligations. (38) Provision should be made for the Commission to be notified of the information it requires in order to ensure that the conditions for the use of the graphic symbol are as uniform as possible throughout the different outermost regions. (39) For the purposes of exempting tobacco imported into the Canary Islands from customs duties, it is necessary to define the annual period for calculating the maximum quantity of tobacco products referred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 and to define the term "local manufacture of tobacco products".
In addition, in order to ensure maximum flexibility, permission should be granted for the overall quantity of unmanufactured stemmed/stripped tobacco to be used for imports of other products, on the basis of a coefficient of equivalence, depending on the requirements of the local industry. (40) As a general rule, the Member States should take any further measures necessary to ensure that this Regulation is properly implemented. (41) Where appropriate, the Commission should be informed of any measures taken by the Member States to implement the aid schemes provided for in this Regulation.
Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation: (a) "outermost regions" means the regions referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, each of the French overseas departments being considered as a separate outermost region; (b) "competent authorities" means the authorities appointed to implement this Regulation by the Member State of which the outermost region concerned is part; (c) "programme" means the overall programme referred to in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.
