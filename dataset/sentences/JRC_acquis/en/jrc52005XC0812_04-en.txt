From various investigations, it results that important quantities of garlic of Chinese origin are declared with another origin and then benefit from the tariff measures mentioned above, beyond the annual quota of 13200 tonnes allocated to China.
Community operators declaring and/or presenting documentary evidence of origin for garlic of tariff heading CN 07032000 are therefore advised to take all the necessary precautions, since the release of the goods in question for free circulation may give rise to a customs debt and lead to fraud against the Community's financial interests.
