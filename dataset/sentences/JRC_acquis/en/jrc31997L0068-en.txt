Starting the dilution system and engine The dilution system and the engine shall be started and warmed up until all temperatures and pressures have stabilized at full load and rated speed (section 3.6.2). 3.4.
The particulate background level of the dilution air may be determined by passing dilution air through the particulate filters.
The dilution air shall be set to obtain a maximum filter face temperature of 325 K (52 °C) or less at each mode.
This mass ratio shall be within ± 5 %, except for the first 10 seconds of each mode for systems without bypass capability.
For partial flow dilution systems with single filter method, the mass flow rate through the filter shall be constant within ± 5 % during each mode, except for the first 10 seconds of each mode for systems without bypass capability.

The sampling time per mode must be at least 20 seconds for the single filter method and at least 60 seconds for the multi-filter method.
For systems without bypass capability, the sampling time per mode must be a least 60 seconds for single and multiple filter methods. 3.6.6.
The methods of Annex V describe the recommended analytical systems for the gaseous emissions (section 1.1) and the recommended particulate dilution and sampling systems (section 1.2). 1.1.
Exhaust gas flow The exhaust gas flow shall be determined by one of the methods mentioned in sections 1.2.1 to 1.2.4. 1.2.1.
The calculation of the exhaust gas flow is as follows: GEXHW = GAIRW + GFUEL (for wet exhaust mass) or VEXHD = VAIRD - 0,766 × GFUEL (for dry exhaust volume) or VEXHW = VAIRW + 0,746 × GFUEL (for wet exhaust volume) 1.2.3.
Carbon balance method Exhaust mass calculation from fuel consumption and exhaust gas concentrations using the carbon balance method (see Annex III, Appendix 3). 1.2.4.
It is recommended that the analysers be operated such that the measured concentration falls between 15 % and 100 % of full scale.
If the full scale value is 155 ppm (or ppm C) or less or if read-out systems (computers, data loggers) that provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 % of full scale are used concentrations below 15 % of full scale are also acceptable.
Measurement error The total measurement error, including the cross sensitivity to other gases - see Annex III, Appendix 2, point 1.9 shall not exceed ± 5 % of the reading or 3,5 % of full scale, whichever is smaller.
For concentrations of less than 100 ppm the measurement error shall not exceed ± 4 ppm. 1.4.1.2.

Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) analysis The oxides of nitrogen analyser shall be of the chemiluminescent detector (CLD) or heated chemiluminescent detector (HCLD) type with a NO2/NO converter, if measured on a dry basis.
If the composition of the exhaust gas is influenced by any exhaust after-treatment system, the exhaust sample must be taken upstream of this device in the tests of stage I and downstream of this device in the tests of stage II.
The flow capacity of the dilution system shall be large enough to completely eliminate water condensation in the dilution and sampling systems, and maintain the temperature of the diluted exhaust gas at or below 325 K (52 °C) immediately upstream of the filter holders.
Dilution air pre-heating above the temperature limit of 303 K (30 °C) is recommended, if the ambient temperature is below 293 K (20 °C).
However, the diluted air temperature must not exceed 325 K (52 °C) prior to the introduction of the exhaust in the dilution tunnel.
For a partial flow dilution system, the particulate sampling probe must be fitted close to and upstream of the gaseous probe as defined in section 4.4 and in accordance with Annex V, section 1.2.1.1, figures 4-12 EP and SP.
For particulate sampling, two methods may be applied: - the single filter method uses one pair of filters (see section 1.5.1.3 of this Appendix) for all modes of the test cycle.
However, only one pair of filters will be required for the test cycle, - the multiple filter method dictates that one pair of filters (see section 1.5.1.3 of this Appendix) is used for each of the individual modes of the test cycle.
Particulate sampling filters 1.5.1.1.
All filter types shall have a 0,3 µm DOP (di-octylphthalate) collection efficiency of at least 95 % at a gas face velocity between 35 and 80 cm/s.
The back-up filter shall be located no more than 100 mm downstream of, and shall not be in contact with the primary filter.
The filters may be weighed separately or as a pair with the filters placed stain side to stain side. 1.5.1.4.
Filter face velocity A gas face velocity through the filter of 35 to 80 cm/s shall be achieved.
The pressure drop increase between the beginning and the end of the test shall be no more than 25 kPa. 1.5.1.5.
Filter loading The recommended minimum filter loading shall be 0,5 mg/1 075 mm² stain area for the single filter method.
The humidity shall be maintained to a dewpoint of 282,5 (9,5 °C) ± 3 K and a relative humidity of 45 ± 8 %. 1.5.2.2.
Disturbances to weighing room specifications as outlined in section 1.5.2.1 will be allowed if the duration of the disturbances does not exceed 30 minutes.
If the average weight of the reference filters (reference filter pairs) changes between sample filter weighing by more than ± 5 % (± 7,5 % for the filter pair) of the recommended minimum filter loading (section 1.5.1.5), then all sample filters shall be discarded and the emissions test repeated.
Analytical balance The analytical balance used to determine the weights of all filters shall have a precision (standard deviation) of 20 µg and a resolution of 10 µg (1 digit = 10 µg).
The calibration method that shall be used is described in this paragraph for the analysers indicated in Appendix 1, section 1.4.3. 1.2.
The following gases must be available for operation: - purified nitrogen (contamination %amp%le; 1 ppm C, %amp%le; 1 ppm CO, %amp%le; 400 ppm CO2, %amp%le; 0,1 ppm NO) - purified oxygen (purity %gt% 99,5 % vol O2) - hydrogen-helium mixture (40 ± 2 % hydrogen, balance helium) (contamination %amp%le; 1 ppm C, %amp%le; 400 ppm CO) - purified synthetic air (contamination %amp%le; 1 ppm C, %amp%le; 1 ppm CO, %amp%le; 400 ppm CO2, %amp%le; 0,1 ppm NO) (oxygen content between 18-21 % vol) 1.2.2.
The accuracy of the mixing device must be such that the concentration of the diluted calibration gases may be determined to within ± 2 %. 1.3.
The minimum requirements given in sections 1.4 to 1.9 shall be included. 1.4.
Calibration procedure 1.5.1.
The highest nominal concentration must be equal to or higher than 90 % of full scale.
The calibration curve must not differ by more than ± 2 % from the nominal value of each calibration point and by more than ± 1 % of full scale at zero.
The calibration curve must not differ by more than ± 4 % from the nominal value of each calibration point and by more than ± 1 % of full scale at zero. 1.5.5.3.
The calibration is checked by using a zero gas and a span gas whose nominal value is more than 80 % of full scale of the measuring range.
Should this not be the case, a new calibration curve shall be established in accordance with section 1.5.4. 1.7.
Efficiency test of the NOx converter The efficiency of the converter used for the conversion of NO2 into NO is tested as given in sections 1.7.1 to 1.7.8 (Figure 1). 1.7.1.
The NOx analyser must be in the NO mode so that the span gas does not pass through the converter.
Calculation The efficiency of the NOx converter is calculated as follows: Efficiency (%) = (1 + %gt%NUM%gt%a - b %gt%DEN%gt%c - d ) × 100 (a) NOx concentration according to section 1.7.6; (b) NOx concentration according to section 1.7.7; (c) NO concentration according to section 1.7.4; (d) NO concentration according to section 1.7.5. 1.7.4.
Activation of the ozonator The ozonator is now activated to generate enough ozone to bring the NO concentration down to about 20 % (minimum 10 %) of the calibration concentration given in section 1.7.2.
The indicated concentration (d) shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NO mode.) 1.7.6.
NOx mode The NO analyser is then switched to the NOx mode so that the gas mixture (consisting of NO, NO2, O2 and N2) now passes through the converter.
The indicated concentration (a) shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NOx mode.) 1.7.7.
The indicated concentration (b) shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NOx mode.) 1.7.8.
The NOx reading of the analyser shall not deviate by more than ± 5 % from the value measured according to section 1.7.2. (The analyser is in the NO mode.) 1.7.9.
Efficiency requirement The efficiency of the converter shall not be less than 90 %, but a higher efficiency of 95 % is strongly recommended.
Note: If, with the analyser in the most common range, the ozonator cannot give a reduction from 80 % to 20 % according to section 1.7.5, then the highest range which will give the reduction shall be used. 1.8.
With the fuel and air flow rates set at the manufacturer's recommendations, a 350 ± 75 ppm C span gas shall be introduced to the analyser.
The response factor (Rf) for a particular hydrocarbon species is the ratio of the FID C1 reading to the gas concentration in the cylinder expressed by ppm C1.
The concentration of the test gas must be at a level to give a response of approximately 80 % of full scale.
The concentration must be known to an accuracy of ± 2 % in reference to a gravimetric standard expressed in volume.
The test gases to be used and the recommended relative response factor ranges are as follows: %gt%TABLE%gt% These values are relative to the response factor (Rf) of 1,00 for propane and purified synthetic air. 1.8.3.
The interference checks in sections 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 shall be performed prior to an analyser's initial use and after major service intervals. 1.9.1.
NOx analyser quench checks The two gases of concern for CLD (and HCLD) analysers are CO2 and water vapour.
CO2 quench check A CO2 span gas having a concentration of 80 to 100 % of full scale of the maximum operating range shall be passed through the NDIR analyser and the CO2 value recorded as A.
It shall then be diluted approximately 50 % with NO span gas and passed through the NDIR and (H)CLD with the CO2 and NO values recorded as B and C, respectively.
The CO2 shall be shut off and only the NO span gas be passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as D.
Calculation of water quench must consider dilution of the NO span gas with water vapour and scaling of water vapour concentration of the mixture to that expected during testing.
A NO span gas having a concentration of 80 to 100 % of full scale to the normal operating range shall be passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as D.
The NO gas shall be bubbled through water at room temperature and passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as C.
The mixture's saturation vapour pressure that corresponds to the bubbler water temperature (F) shall be determined and recorded as G.

Determination of the particulates Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 and Figures 4 to 15 contain detailed descriptions of the recommended dilution and sampling systems.
Dilution system 1.2.1.1.
Partial flow dilution system (Figures 4 to 12) A dilution system is described based on the dilution of a part of the exhaust stream.
The following types are recommended: - isokinetic systems (Figures 4 and 5) With these systems, the flow into the transfer tube is matched to the bulk exhaust flow in terms of gas velocity and/or pressure, thus requiring an undisturbed and uniform exhaust flow at the sampling probe.
The latter is typically not necessary, as the particles are sufficiently small as to follow the fluid streamlines, - flow controlled systems with concentration measurement (Figures 6 to 10) With these systems, a sample is taken from the bulk exhaust stream by adjusting the dilution air flow and the total dilution exhaust flow.
The dilution ratio is determined from the concentrations of tracer gases, such as CO2 or NOx, naturally occurring in the engine exhaust.
The concentrations in the dilution exhaust gas and in the dilution air are measured, whereas the concentration in the raw exhaust gas can be either measured directly or determined from fuel flow and the carbon balance equation, if the fuel composition is known.
The systems may be controlled by the calculated dilution ratio (Figures 6 and 7) or by the flow into the transfer tube (Figures 8, 9 and 10), - flow controlled systems with flow measurement (Figures 11 and 12) With these systems, a sample is taken from the bulk exhaust stream by setting the dilution air flow and the total dilution exhaust flow.
The dilution ratio is determined from the difference of the two flow rates.
Accurate calibration of the flow-meters relative to one another is required, since the relative magnitude of the two flow rates can lead to significant errors at higher dilution ratios (Figures 9 and above).
Figure 4 Partial flow dilution system with isokinetic probe and fractional sampling (SB control) %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe to EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the transfer tube TT by the isokinetic sampling probe ISP.
The differential pressure of the exhaust gas between exhaust pipe and inlet to the probe is measured with the pressure transducer DPT.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical, and the flow through ISP and TT is a constant fraction (split) of the exhaust gas flow.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the dilution air flow rate and the split ratio.

The differential pressure of the exhaust gas between exhaust pipe and inlet to the probe is measured with the pressure transducer DPT.
This signal is transmitted to the flow controller FC1 that controls the pressure blower PB to maintain a differential pressure of zero at the tip of the probe.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical, and the flow through ISP and TT is a constant fraction (split) of the exhaust gas flow.
The dilution air is sucked through DT by the suction blower SB, and the flow rate is measured with FM1 at the inlet to DT.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the dilution air flow rate and the split ratio.

The concentrations of a tracer gas (CO2 or NOx) are measured in the raw and diluted exhaust gas as well as in the dilution air with the exhaust gas analyser(s) EGA.
These signals are transmitted to the flow controller FC2 that controls either the pressure blower PB or the suction blower SB to maintain the desired exhaust split and dilution ratio in DT.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the tracer gas concentrations in the raw exhaust gas, the diluted exhaust gas, and the dilution air.

The first one (FD1) is located in EP, the second one (FD2) in TT.
Additionally, two pressure control valves (PCV1 and PCV2) are necessary to maintain a constant exhaust split by controlling the backpressure in EP and the pressure in DT.
PCV1 is located downstream of SP in EP, PCV2 between the pressure blower PB and DT.
The tracer gas concentrations (CO2 or NOx) are measured in the raw exhaust gas, the diluted exhaust gas, and the dilution air with the exhaust gas analyser(s) EGA.
They are necessary for checking the exhaust split, and may be used to adjust PCV1 and PCV2 for precise split control.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the tracer gas concentrations.

The tracer gas concentrations (CO2 or NOx) are measured in the raw exhaust gas, the diluted exhaust gas, and the dilution air with the exhaust gas analyser(s) EGA.

The dilution air flow rate is measured with flow measurement device FM1, the total flow rate with the flow measurement device FM3 of the particulate sampling system (see Figure 14).
The dilution ratio is calculated from these two flow rates.

The dilution ratio is calculated from these two flow rates.
Description - Figures 4 to 12 - EP exhaust pipe The exhaust pipe may be insulated.
The gas velocity at the sampling zone must be higher than 10 m/s except at idle mode.
Pressure oscillations of the exhaust gas must not exceed ± 500 Pa on the average.
For systems without isokinetic probes, it is recommended to have a straight pipe of six pipe diameters upstream and three pipe diameters downstream of the tip of the probe. - SP sampling probe (Figures 6 to 12) The minimum inside diameter shall be 4 mm.
The probe shall be an open tube facing upstream on the exhaust pipe centre-line, or a multiple hole probe as described under SP1 in section 1.1.1. - ISP isokinetic sampling probe (Figures 4 and 5) The isokinetic sampling probe must be installed facing upstream on the exhaust pipe centre-line where the flow conditions in section EP are met, and designed to provide a proportional sample of the raw exhaust gas.
The minimum inside diameter shall be 12 mm.
The ISP has to be connected to a differential pressure transducer.
The control to provide a differential pressure of zero between EP and ISP is done with blower speed or flow controller. - FD1, FD2 flow divider (Figure 9) A set of venturis or orifices is installed in the exhaust pipe EP and in the transfer tube TT, respectively, to provide a proportional sample of the raw exhaust gas.
A control system consisting of two pressure control valves PCV1 and PCV2 is necessary for proportional splitting by controlling the pressures in EP and DT. - FD3 flow divider (Figure 10) A set of tubes (multiple tube unit) is installed in the exhaust pipe EP to provide a proportional sample of the raw exhaust gas.
One of the tubes feeds exhaust gas to the dilution tunnel DT, whereas the other tubes exit exhaust gas to a damping chamber DC.
A control system is necessary for proportional splitting by maintaining a differential pressure of zero between the exit of the multiple tube unit into DC and the exit of TT.
The control to provide a differential pressure of zero is done with the flow controller FC1. - EGA exhaust gas analyser (Figures 6 to 10) CO2 or NOx analysers may be used (with carbon balance method CO2 only).
The accuracy of the measuring systems has to be such that the accuracy of GEDFW,i or VEDFW,i is within ± 4 %. - TT transfer tube (Figures 4 to 12) The particulate sample transfer tube shall be: - as short as possible, but not more than 5 m in length, - equal to or greater than the probe diameter, but not more than 25 mm in diameter, - exiting on the centre-line of the dilution tunnel and pointing down-stream.
If the tube is longer than 1 metre, it must be insulated and heated to a minimum wall temperature of 523 K (250 °C).
Alternatively, the transfer tube wall temperatures required may be determined through standard heat transfer calculations. - DPT differential pressure transducer (Figures 4, 5 and 10) The differential pressure transducer shall have a range of ± 500 Pa or less. - FC1 flow controller (Figures 4, 5 and 10) For the isokinetic systems (Figures 4 and 5) a flow controller is necessary to maintain a differential pressure of zero between EP and ISP.
The adjustment can be done by: (a) controlling the speed or flow of the suction blower (SB) and keeping the speed of the pressure blower (PB) constant during each mode (Figure 4); or (b) adjusting the suction blower (SB) to a constant mass flow of the diluted exhaust and controlling the flow of the pressure blower PB, and therefore the exhaust sample flow in a region at the end of the transfer tube (TT) (Figure 5).
The pressure oscillations in the dilution tunnel must not exceed ± 250 Pa on average.
For a multi-tube system (Figure 10) a flow controller is necessary for proportional exhaust splitting to maintain a differential pressure of zero between the outlet of the multi-tube unit and the exit of TT.
The adjustment can be done by controlling the injection air flow rate into DT at the exit of TT. - PCV1, PCV2 pressure control valve (Figure 9) Two pressure control valves are necessary for the twin venturi/twin orifice system for proportional flow splitting by controlling the backpressure of EP and the pressure in DT.
The valves shall be located downstream of SP in EP and between PB and DT. - DC damping chamber (Figure 10) A damping chamber shall be installed at the exit of the multiple tube unit to minimize the pressure oscillations in the exhaust pipe EP. - VN venturi (Figure 8) A venturi is installed in the dilution tunnel DT to create a negative pressure in the region of the exit of the transfer tube TT.
Since the momentum exchange is affected by the temperature at the exit of TT and the pressure difference between EP and DT, the actual dilution ratio is slightly lower at low load than at high load. - FC2 flow controller (Figures 6, 7, 11 and 12; optional) A flow controller may be used to control the flow of the pressure blower PB and/or the suction blower SB.
When using a pressurized air supply (Figure 11) FC2 directly controls the air flow. - FM1 flow measurement device (Figures 6, 7, 11 and 12) Gas meter or other flow instrumentation to measure the dilution air flow.
FM1 is optional if PB is calibrated to measure the flow. - FM2 flow measurement device (Figure 12) Gas meter or other flow instrumentation to measure the diluted exhaust gas flow.
FM2 is optional if the suction blower SB is calibrated to measure the flow. - PB pressure blower (Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12) To control the dilution air flow rate, PB may be connected to the flow controllers FC1 or FC2.
PB may be used to measure the dilution air flow, if calibrated. - SB suction blower (Figures 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12) For fractional sampling systems only.
Note: If the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the dilution tunnel (DT) is below 293 K (20 °C), precautions should be taken to avoid particle losses onto the cool walls of the dilution tunnel.
At high engine loads, the tunnel may be cooled by a non-aggressive means such as a circulating fan, as long as the temperature of the cooling medium is not below 293 K (20 °C). - HE heat exchanger (Figures 9 and 10) The heat exchanger shall be of sufficient capacity to maintain the temperature at the inlet to the suction blower SB within ± 11 K of the average operating temperature observed during the test. 1.2.1.2.
Full flow dilution system (Figure 13) A dilution system is described based upon the dilution of the total exhaust using the constant volume sampling (CVS) concept.
Therefore, the sampling probes for the gaseous components are shown in Figure 13 but do not appear in the description list.
The respective requirements are described in section 1.1.1.
Descriptions - Figure 13 - EP exhaust pipe The exhaust pipe length from the exit of the engine exhaust manifold, turbocharger outlet or after-treatment device to the dilution tunnel is required to be not more than 10 m.
The radial thickness of the insulation must be at least 25 mm.
The thermal conductivity of the insulating material must have a value no greater than 0,1 W/(m 7 K) measured at 673 K (400 °C).
Figure 13 Full flow dilution system %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% The total amount of raw exhaust gas is mixed in the dilution tunnel DT with the dilution air.
Since particulate mass determination is based on the total diluted exhaust gas flow, the dilution ratio is not required to be calculated. - PDP positive displacement pump The PDP meters total diluted exhaust flow from the number of the pump revolutions and the pump displacement.
Static exhaust back pressure measured with the CVS system operating shall remain within ± 1,5 kPa of the static pressure measured without connection to the CVS at identical engine speed and load.
The gas mixture temperature immediately ahead of the PDP shall be within ± 6 K of the average operating temperature observed during the test, when no flow compensation is used.
Flow compensation can only be used if the temperature at the inlet of the PDP does not exceed 50 °C (323 K). - CFV critical flow venturi CFV measures total diluted exhaust flow by maintaining the flow at choked conditions (critical flow).
Static exhaust backpressure measured with the CFV system operating shall remain within ± 1,5 kPa of the static pressure measured without connection to the CFV at identical engine speed and load.
A mixing orifice may be used, - shall be at least 75 mm in diameter, - may be insulated.
The flow capacity of the PDP or CFV must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust at a temperature of less than or equal to 325 K (52 °C) immediately before the primary particulate filter.
When using double dilution, a sample from the dilution tunnel is transferred to the secondary dilution tunnel where it is further diluted, and then passed through the sampling filters (section 1.2.2, Figure 15).
The flow capacity of the PDP or CFV must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the DT at a temperature of less than or equal to 464 K (191 °C) at the sampling zone.
The secondary dilution system must provide sufficient secondary dilution air to maintain the doubly-diluted exhaust stream at a temperature of less than or equal to 325 K (52 °C) immediately before the primary particulate filter. - DAF dilution air filter It is recommended that the dilution air be filtered and charcoal scrubbed to eliminate background hydrocarbons.
Particulate sampling system (Figures 14 and 15) The particulate sampling system is required for collecting the particulates on the particulate filter.
In the case of fractional sampling partial flow dilution or full flow dilution, which consists of passing through the filters only a portion of the diluted exhaust, the dilution (section 1.2.1.1, Figures 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 12 and section 1.2.1.2, Figure 13) and sampling systems usually form different units.
Figure 14 Particulate sampling system %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% A sample of the diluted exhaust gas is taken from the dilution tunnel DT of a partial flow or full flow dilution system through the particulate sampling probe PSP and the particulate transfer tube PTT by means of the sampling pump P.
The sample is passed through the filter holders(s) FH that contain the particulate sampling filters.
The sample flow rate is controlled by the flow controller FC3.
Figure 15 Dilution system (full flow system only) %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% A sample of the diluted exhaust gas is transferred from the dilution tunnel DT of a full flow dilution system through the particulate sampling probe PSP and the particulate transfer tube PTT to the secondary dilution tunnel SDT, where it is diluted once more.
The sample is then passed through the filter holder(s) FH that contain the particulate sampling filters.
If electronic flow compensation EFC (see Figure 13) is used, the total diluted exhaust gas flow is used as command signal for FC3. - PTT particulate transfer tube (Figures 14 and 15) The particulate transfer tube must not exceed 1 020 mm in length, and must be minimized in length whenever possible.
The dimensions are valid for: - the partial flow dilution fractional sampling type and the full flow single dilution system from the probe tip to the filter holder, - the partial flow dilution total sampling type from the end of the dilution tunnel to the filter holder, - the full flow double dilution system from the probe tip to the secondary dilution tunnel.
The transfer tube: - may be heated to no greater than 325 K (52 °C) wall temperature by direct heating or by dilution air pre-heating, provided the air temperature does not exceed 325 K (52 °C) prior to the introduction of the exhaust in the dilution tunnel, - may be insulated. - SDT secondary dilution tunnel (Figure 15) The secondary dilution tunnel should have a minimum diameter of 75 mm and should be sufficient length so as to provide a residence time of at least 0,25 seconds for the doubly-diluted sample.
The primary filter holder, FH, shall be located within 300 mm of the exit of the SDT.
The secondary dilution tunnel: - may be heated to no greater than 325 K (52 °C) wall temperature by direct heating or by dilution air pre-heating, provided the air temperature does not exceed 325 K (52 °C) prior to the introduction of the exhaust in the dilution tunnel, - may be insulated. - FH filter holder(s) (Figures 14 and 15) For primary and back-up filters one filter housing or separate filter housings may be used.
The filter holder(s): - may be heated to no greater than 325 K (52 °C) wall temperature by direct heating or by dilution air pre-heating, provided the air temperature does not exceed 325 K (52 °C), - may be insulated. - P sampling pump (Figures 14 und 15) The particulate sampling pump shall be located sufficiently distant from the tunnel so that the inlet gas temperature is maintained constant (± 3 K), if flow correction by FC3 is not used. - DP dilution air pump (Figure 15) (full flow double dilution only) The dilution air pump shall be located so that the secondary dilution air is supplied at a temperature of 298 K (25 °C) ± 5 K. - FC3 flow controller (Figures 14 und 15) A flow controller shall be used to compensate the particulate sample flow rate for temperature and backpressure variations in the sample path, if no other means are available.
The flow controller is required if electronic flow compensation EFC (see Figure 13) is used. - FM3 flow measurement device (Figures 14 und 15) (particulate sample flow) The gas meter or flow instrumentation shall be located sufficiently distant from the sample pump so that the inlet gas temperature remains constant (± 3 K), if flow correction by FC3 is not used. - FM4 flow measurement device (Figure 15) (dilution air, full flow double dilution only) The gas meter or flow instrumentation shall be located so that the inlet gas temperature remains at 298 K (25 °C) ± 5 K. - BV ball valve (optional) The ball valve shall have a diameter not less than the inside diameter of the sampling tube and a switching time of less than 0,5 seconds.
Note: If the ambient temperature in the vicinity of PSP, PTT, SDT, and FH is below 239 K (20 °C), precautions should be taken to avoid particle losses onto the cool wall of these parts.
It is also recommended that the filter face temperature during sampling be not below 293 K (20 °C).
At high engine loads, the above parts may be cooled by a non-aggressive means such as a circulating fan, as long as the temperature of the cooling medium is not below 293 K (20 °C).
