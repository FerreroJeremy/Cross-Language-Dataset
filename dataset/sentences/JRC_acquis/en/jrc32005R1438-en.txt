They are not, however, included among the basic cereals referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 for which provision is made for intervention buying-in. (2) Oats are a major traditional crop in Finland and Sweden and are well suited to the weather conditions obtaining in those countries.
It is necessary therefore to ensure that exports of oats to third countries can continue. (4) Refunds may be granted in respect of oats under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003.
The fixing of refunds on the basis of Article 13 favours primarily exports from other Member States.
Consequently, in coming years, substantial quantities of barley must be expected to enter intervention storage in Finland and Sweden under Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003, the only possibility of disposal being export to third countries.
Exports from intervention storage are more costly to the Community budget than direct exports. (5) These additional costs can be avoided under a special intervention measure within the meaning of Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003.
A special intervention measure in the form of an export refund shall be implemented in respect of 400000 tonnes of oats produced in Finland and Sweden and intended for export from Finland and Sweden to all third countries, except Bulgaria, Norway, Romania and Switzerland.
Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and the provisions adopted for the application of that Article shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to that refund. 2.
Tenders shall be invited in order to determine the amount of the refund referred to in Article 1(1). 2.
The invitations to tender shall be open until 22 June 2006.
Notwithstanding Article 4(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95, the time limit for the submission of tenders for the first partial invitation to tender shall be 15 September 2005. 4.
The tendering procedure shall take place in accordance with this Regulation and Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.
Article 3 Offers shall not be valid unless: (a) they relate to not less than 1000 tonnes; (b) they are accompanied by a written undertaking from the tenderer specifying that they relate solely to oats grown in Finland and Sweden which are to be exported from those countries.
Where the undertaking referred to in (b) is not fulfilled, the security referred to in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 [5] shall be forfeited, except in cases of force majeure.
Article 4 Under the tendering procedure laid down in Article 2, one of the following entries shall be made in box 20 of applications and export licences: in Finnish: "Asetus (EY) N:o 1438/2005 – Todistus on voimassa ainoastaan Suomessa ja Ruotsissa", in Swedish: "Förordning (EG) nr 1438/2005 – Licensen giltig endast i Finland och Sverige".
Article 5 The refund shall be valid only for exports from Finland and Sweden.
Article 6 The security referred to in Article 5(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 shall be EUR 12 per tonne.
Notwithstanding Article 23(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 [6], export licences issued in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 shall, for the purpose of determining their period of validity, be deemed to have been issued on the day on which the tender was submitted. 2.
Export licences issued under the tendering procedure laid down in Article 2 shall be valid from their date of issue, as defined in paragraph 1 of this Article, until the end of the fourth month following that of issue. 3.
Notwithstanding Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, export licences issued under the tendering procedure laid down in Article 2 of this Regulation shall be valid in Finland and Sweden only.
Article 8 The Finnish and Swedish intervention agencies shall electronically notify the Commission of the tenders submitted not later than one and a half hours following expiry of the deadline for the weekly submission of tenders as specified in the notice of invitation to tender, using the form shown in the Annex hereto.
Article 9 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
