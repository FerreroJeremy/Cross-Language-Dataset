EDF Financial Performance The performance of the EDF in 2003 has been the best ever.
The high level of the commitments can be partially explained by the fact that 2003 was the first year of the implementation of the 9th EDF.
The 2004 Mid-term Review During 2004 mid-term reviews (MTRs) have been undertaken in all ACP countries for which a Country Strategy Paper (CSP), the basis of the EDF programming exercise, has been signed[3].
The financial proposals which have been submitted to the EDF Committee in fall 2004 and on which final Commission Decisions are foreseen in December can be indicatively summarised as follows: - For 17 countries no change in envelopes is proposed. - For 13 countries a transfer between the envelope of programmable funds and the envelope for unforeseen needs) is proposed, leaving the amount of total resources unchanged; in most cases this has been a transfer from the underutilised envelope for unforeseen needs to the envelope for programmable funds which, consolidated, increase by €226million (of which 62% in favour of least developed countries. - For 17 countries, a net increase in allocations is proposed (in many instances, this includes a transfer between envelopes); the net increase amounts to €766million (a €989million increase in the envelopes for programmable funds, partly offset by a €223million decrease in the envelopes for unforeseen needs), of which 97% in favour of least developed countries. - For 15 countries, a net decrease in the total allocation is proposed (two of which involve a cut in the A envelope); the net decrease amounts to €432million (with a net increase of programmable funds of only €33million) of which 84% concerns least developed countries.
The 2006 end-of-term review will allow correction of existing forecasts and a final reallocation of funds, further increasing the prospect that, by the end of 2007, all the remaining balances will be committed.
Proposals for the use of the Conditional Balances Based on the conclusions of the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the future development of the EU Water Facility and on a preliminary EDF performance review, the Council agreed on 22 March 2004 to consider earmarking an amount of €500million out of the conditional €1billion in support of an European water initiative for the ACP Countries[6].
The 2004 mid-term reviews led to a reallocation of resources between ACP countries based on performance, without requiring additional funding.
The interest gathered from all stakeholders in various international fora increases the likelihood of a very positive preliminary response to this call, which will be confirmed in early 2005 on receipt of the preliminary proposals.
International commitments 1.
In response to this challenge, the Council adopted in April 2004 an EU Action Plan prepared by the Commission, which includes a proposal to facilitate producer access to commodity risk insurance and trade finance[12].
To contribute to a pan-African support programme, it is proposed to earmark an indicative amount of up to €50 million from the remaining balance of the conditional billion, and to transfer the amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. 5.

Done at Brussels, For the Council The President EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The Financial Protocol attached as Annex 1 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000, establishes in its paragraph 2 a 9th EDF for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries of a total amount of up to EUR 13.5 billion.
This performance review is to be undertaken in 2004, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, in accordance with Declaration XVIII attached to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement as well as Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement between Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid under the Financial Protocol to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
On 22 March 2004 the Council agreed to the establishment of an ‘EU Water Facility’ for ACP countries, to consider an amount of EUR 500 million out of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement for this Water Facility and to release a first allocation of EUR 250 million.
In 2003 the joint ACP-EU Council approved the accession of Timor Leste to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
Paragraph 7 of the Financial Protocol and Declaration XVIII specify that this performance review shall be an assessment of the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements. (3) On 22 March 2004 the Council agreed to the establishment of a Water Facility for ACP countries, to consider an amount of EUR 500 million out of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement, for this water facility and to release a first allocation of EUR 250 million.
The Decision did not take into account the fact that, after ratification of the Cotonou Agreement, Timor Leste will no longer qualify for the development assistance which has been provided for until now under Council Regulation 443/92 (the ALA Regulation).
Article 4 This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.
Done at Brussels, For the Council The President EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The Financial Protocol attached as Annex 1 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000, states in paragraph 2 that the Community’s financial assistance from the 9th EDF for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries shall comprise a total amount of up to EUR 13.5 billion.
This performance review is to be undertaken in 2004, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, in accordance with Declaration XVIII attached to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement as well as Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement between Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid under the Financial Protocol to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
On 22 March 2004 the Council agreed on the establishment of an ‘EU Water Facility’ for ACP countries, to consider an amount of EUR 500 million out of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement for this water facility and to release a first allocation of EUR 250 million.
It is therefore proposed to release the EUR 482 million and to allocate them on the basis of the obligations resulting from the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and for contributions to international initiatives and commitments.
Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION concerning the release and use of the remaining EUR 482 million of the conditional EUR 1 billion under the 9th European Development Fund for cooperation with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 310, in conjunction with the second subparagraph of Article 300(2) thereof, Having regard to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 Having regard to Article 1 of the Internal Agreement between the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for the implementation of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, Having regard to the Internal Agreement between the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on the financing and administration of Community aid under the Financial Protocol to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, signed on 18 September 2000, and in particular Article 2(2) thereof (Internal Agreement) Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement, as well as the EU Declaration on the Financial Protocol, attached as Declaration XVIII to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, out of the total amount of EUR 13.5 billion of the ninth EDF for ACP countries, only EUR 12.5 billion were released upon the entry into force of the Financial Protocol on 1 April 2003. (2) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement an amount of EUR 1 billion may be released only following a performance review undertaken by the Council in 2004, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
Paragraph 7 of the Financial Protocol and Declaration XVIII specify that this performance review shall be an assessment of the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements. (3) On 22 March 2004 the Council agreed on the establishment of a Water Facility for ACP countries, to consider an amount of EUR 500 million out of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement, for this water facility and to release a first allocation of EUR 250 million.
This decision was taken on the basis that the level of commitments and disbursements at the end of the year 2003 in conjunction with forecasts for the period 2004 to 2007 presented by the Commission indicating that ninth EDF resources for ACP countries could be fully committed. (4) By the same decision the Council decided that, in the light of the outcome of the mid-term reviews of the country strategies and of its own performance review of the EDF by the end of 2004, the Council would decide by March 2005 on the mobilisation of a second allocation of EUR 250 million for the Water Facility and on the use of the remaining EUR 500 million of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement for purposes to be agreed. (5) The 9th EDF, including the balances transferred from the previous EDFs, will be entirely committed by the end of 2007 without allowing the Community to fully comply with its international commitments and to respond to new international initiatives. (6) A selection of proposals has been made for the total amount of EUR 482 million on the basis of the obligations resulting from the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and on the basis of the so far unmet joint ACP-EC commitments on the international scene, taking into account the principles of urgency and poverty focus, concentration of aid and absorption capacity. (7) Under the existing implementation modalities of the Centre for the Development of the Enterprise (CDE) and the Centre for the Development of Agriculture (CTA) the annual budgetary needs are estimated at respectively EUR 18 million and EUR 14 million.
It is therefore proposed to earmark EUR 64 million out of the long-term development envelope released from the remaining conditional billion in resources to cover the functioning of the CDE and CTA during the years 2006-2007, in compliance with Annexes I and III to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. (8) The Communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament COM (2004) 711 of 28 October 2004 on the future development of the EU Energy Initiative and the modalities for the establishment of an Energy Facility for ACP countries proposed to mobilise EUR 250 million for this initiative.
Article 12 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement on coherence of Community policies foresees that, in such cases and at the request of the ACP, consultations be held so that account may be taken of their concerns as to the impact of these measures.
It is therefore proposed to put aside an indicative amount of €30 million from the remaining balance of the conditional billion to contribute to the initial phase of a capacity building programme to help the ACP adapt to the new EU sanitary and phyto-sanitary rules and to transfer the entire amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. (11) Considering the increasing importance of the African Union (AU) in peacekeeping and conflict prevention as well as in promoting regional integration and good governance, and the positive reception by the Council of the Communication on an enhanced EU-Africa dialogue[33], it seems appropriate to move towards a more strategic support to the AU institutions and to reserve an additional amount for a pan-African support programme within the framework of the “Vision and Mission of the African Union and Strategic Plan for 2004-2007” adopted by the summit of the Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa in July 2004.
To contribute to a pan-African support programme, it is proposed to earmark an indicative amount of up to EUR 50 million from the remaining balance of the conditional billion, and to transfer the amount to the intra-ACP envelope for this purpose. (12) The Education for All Fast Track Initiative (FTI) is a global partnership, launched in mid-2002 to help low-income countries reach the education Millennium Development Goals of giving all children a complete primary education by 2015.
EUR 82 million to the Investment Facility, referred to in Article 2(1)(c) of the Internal Agreement as well as paragraph 3 (c) of the Financial Protocol; Ar ticle 3 EUR 64 million from the envelope for support for long-term development, referred to in Article 2(1)(a)(ii)(iii) of the Internal Agreement as well as paragraph 3(a)(i)(ii) of the Financial Protocol will be allocated for the financing of the budget of the Centre for the Development of Enterprise (CDE) and of the Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation (CTA).
Article 4 The remaining EUR 418 million EUR will contribute to the financing of the following actions: Up to EUR 250 million to the EU Energy Initiative; Up to EUR 25 million for the contribution to the International Commodity Risk Management Financing Facility in favour of the ACP countries; An indicative amount of 30 million to assist the ACP countries in adapting to the new EU sanitary and phyto-sanitary rules; Up to EUR 50 million to strengthen the African Union in the implementation of its pan-African mandate An indicative amount of EUR 63 million as a contribution to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative.
Article 5 This Decision shall be communicated to the ACP Council of Ministers.
Article 6 This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.

Against this background, the Commission proposes that the Council approves the enclosed decision on the position to be adopted by the Community within the ACP-EC Council of Ministers regarding the transfer of EUR 288 million from the reserve of the 9th EDF long-term development envelope as well as EUR 82 million from the 9th EDF Investment Facility, to the allocation for intra-ACP co-operation, to be used for the financing of these initiatives.
Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the position to be adopted by the Community within the ACP-EC Council of Ministers regarding a decision on the use of the reserve of the long-term development envelope as well as of resources from the Investment Facility of the ninth European Development Fund for the financing of the EU Energy Initiative, for the contributions to the International Commodity Risk Management Financing Facility, the adaptation to the new EU feed and food sanitary and phyto sanitary rules, the strengthening of the African Union and a contribution to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 310 in conjunction with the second subparagraph of Article 300 (2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[34], Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement an amount of EUR 1 billion may be released and distributed to the envelopes for long term development, regional cooperation and integration and the Investment Facility only following a performance review undertaken by the Council in 2004, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
Paragraphs 7 of the Financial Protocol and Declaration XVIII specify that this performance review shall be an assessment of the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements. (2) On 22 March 2004 the Council agreed on the establishment of a Water Facility for ACP countries, to consider an amount of EUR 500 million out of the conditional EUR 1 billion referred to in Article 2(2) of the Internal Agreement, for this Water Facility, and to release a first allocation of EUR 250 million.
This decision was taken on the basis that the level of commitments and disbursements at the end of the year 2003 in conjunction with forecasts for the period 2004 to 2007 presented by the Commission indicating that ninth EDF resources for ACP countries could be fully committed. (3) By the same decision the Council decided that in the light of the outcome of the mid-term reviews of the country strategies and of its performance review of the EDF by the end of 2004, the Council would decide by March 2005 on the mobilisation of a second allocation of EUR 250 million for the ACP-EU Water Facility and on the use of the remaining EUR 500 million for purposes to be agreed. (4) A selection of proposals has been made for the total amount of EUR 482 million on the basis of the obligations resulting from the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and on the basis of so far unmet joint ACP-EC commitments on the international scene, taking into account the principles of urgency and poverty focus, concentration of aid and absorption capacity. (5) From the latter amount, EUR 64 million from the envelope for support for long-term development will be allocated for the financing of the budget of the Centre for Development of Enterprise (CDE) and of the Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation (CTA), referred to in Article 2(1)(a)(ii)(iii) of the Internal Agreement as well as paragraph 3(a)(i)(ii) of the Financial Protocol.
The balance of EUR 418 million will be earmarked for the intra-ACP financing of the EU Energy Initiative, an International Commodity Risk Management Financing Facility, the ACP adaptation to the new EU feed and food sanitary and phyto sanitary rules, the strengthening of the African Union and a contribution to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative. (6) Article 15 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 establishes an ACP-EC Council of Ministers with powers to take decisions in accordance with the Agreement and Paragraph 8 of Annex I to that Agreement allows the ACP-EC Council of Ministers to take appropriate measures if funds provided for in any of the instruments of the Agreement are exhausted. (7) Funds from the 9th EDF envelope for regional cooperation and integration are exhausted.
It also agreed to release immediately a first allocation of EUR 250 million from the conditional EUR 1 billion and to decide at the latest by March 2005 on the mobilisation of a second instalment of EUR 250 million and on the use of the remaining EUR 500 million of the conditional EUR 1 billion for purposes to be agreed in the light of the outcome of the mid-term reviews of the country strategies and of the Council’s performance review of the EDF by the end of 2004. (2) To ensure support of the financing of the EU Energy Initiative, for the contributions to the International Commodity Risk Management Financing Facility, the adaptation to the new EU feed and food sanitary and phyto sanitary rules, the strengthen of the African Union and a contribution to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative, it is appropriate to allocate resources to intra-ACP cooperation for a total amount EUR 418 million that can be made available from the resources released by the EU Council of Ministers.
However, the envelope for regional cooperation and integration as defined in Paragraph 3(b) of Annex I to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement is exhausted.
Together with an amount of EUR 48 million already available under the intra-ACP co-operation, a total amount of EUR 418 million will thus be available for the financing of the EU Energy Initiative, for the contributions to the International Commodity Risk Management Financing Facility, the adaptation to the new EU feed and food sanitary and phyto sanitary rules, the strengthening of the African Union and a contribution to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative.
