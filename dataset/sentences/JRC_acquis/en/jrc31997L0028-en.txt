In the case of a lamp having several filaments, each one shall constitute a light source; 2.7.2. 'Equivalent lamps` means lamps having the same function and authorized in the country in which the vehicle is registered; such lamps may have different characteristics from those installed on the vehicle when it is approved on condition that they satisfy the requirements of this Regulation; 2.7.3. 'Independent lamps` means devices having separate illuminating surfaces, (2) separate light sources and separate lamp bodies; 2.7.4. 'Grouped lamps` means devices having separate illuminating surfaces (3) and separate light sources, but a common lamp body; 2.7.5.

For the purpose of installation on a vehicle, a 'single lamp` also means any assembly of two independent or grouped lamps, whether identical or not, having the same function, if they are installed so that the projection of their apparent surfaces in the direction of the reference axis occupies not less than 60 per cent of the smallest rectangle circumscribing the projections of the said apparent surfaces in the direction of the reference axis.
Where the distance between the lamps clearly meets the requirements of the Regulation, the exact edges of apparent surfaces need not be determined. 2.18. 'Operating tell-tale` means a visual or auditory signal (or any equivalent signal) indicating that a device has been switched on and is operating correctly or not; 2.19. 'Closed-circuit tell-tale` means a visual (or any equivalent signal) indicating that a device has been switched on, but not indicating whether it is operating correctly or not; 2.20. 'Optional lamp` means a lamp, the installation of which is left to the discretion of the manufacturer; 2.21. 'Ground` means the surface on which the vehicle stands which should be substantially horizontal; 2.22. 'Movable components` of the vehicle mean those body panels or other vehicle parts the position(s) of which can be changed by tilting, rotating or sliding without the use of tools.
GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
For all light-signalling devices, including those mounted on the side panels, the reference axis of the lamp when fitted to the vehicle must be parallel to the bearing plane of the vehicle on the road; in addition it must be perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle in the case of side retro-reflectors and of side-marker lamps and parallel to that plane in the case of all other signalling devices.
For the visibility of red light towards the front, there must be no direct visibility of the light-emitting surface of a red lamp if viewed by an observer moving within Zone 1 in a transverse plane situated 25 m in front of the vehicle (see Annex 4); 5.10.2.
For the visibility of white light towards the rear, there must be no direct visibility of a light-emitting surface of a white lamp if viewed by an observer moving within Zone 2 in a transverse plane situated 25 m behind the vehicle (see Annex 4); 5.10.3.
The electrical connections must be such that the front and rear position lamps, the end-outline marker lamps, if they exist, the side-marker lamps, if they exist, and the rear registration plate lamp can only be switched on and off simultaneously.
Concealable lamps 5.14.1.
However, in the case of grouped main-beam and dipped-beam headlamps, the control referred to above is required only to activate the dipped-beam headlamps. 5.14.4.
Number of lamps The number of lamps mounted on the vehicle shall be equal to the number(s) specified in subparagraph 2 of each of the paragraphs 6.1 to 6.19. 5.17.
Rear position lamps, rear direction indicators and rear retro-reflectors, triangular as well as non triangular, must not be installed on movable components unless at all fixed positions of the movable components the lamps on the movable components meet all the position, geometric visibility and photometric requirements for those lamps.
There must not be any movable component, with or without a light-signalling device installed on it, which in any fixed position hides more than 50 % of the apparent surface of front and rear position lamps, front and rear direction indicator lamps and retro-reflectors when viewed in the reference axis of this specific device.
a notice in the vehicle shall inform the user that in certain position(s) of the movable components other road users shall be warned of the presence of the vehicle on the road; for example by means of a warning triangle or other devices according to national requirements for use on the road. 5.20.
When a lamp is installed on a movable component and the movable component is in the normal position(s) of use (see paragraph 2.23.), the lamp must always return to the position(s) specified by the manufacturer in accordance with this Regulation.

ANNEX 6 Measurement of the variation of dipped-beam inclination as a function of load 1.
Definitions 2.1.
Initial inclination 2.1.1.
Stated initial inclination The value of the dipped-beam initial inclination specified by the motor vehicle manufacturer serving as a reference value for the calculation of permissible variations. 2.1.2.
Measured initial inclination The mean value of dipped-beam inclination or vehicle inclination measured with the vehicle in condition No 1, as defined in annex 5, for the category of vehicle under test.
Dipped-beam inclination It may be defined as follows: either as the angle, expressed in milliradians, between the direction of the beam towards a characteristic point on the horizontal part of the cut-off in the luminous distribution of the headlamp and the horizontal plane, or by the tangent of that angle, expressed in percentage inclination, since the angles are small (for these small angles, 1 per cent is equal to 10 mrad).
Negative values denote downward inclination (see figure 1).
Where the vehicle does not incorporate a headlamp levelling system, the variation in dipped-beam inclination is identical with the variation in the inclination of the vehicle itself. 3.
Measurement conditions 3.1.
Headlamp centres of reference shall be at a distance from the screen of at least 10 m. 3.2.
The ground on which measurements are made shall be as flat and horizontal as possible, so that the reproducibility of measurements of dipped-beam inclination can be assured with an accuracy of ±0.5 mrad (±0.05 per cent inclination). 3.3.
During measurements, the ambient temperature shall be between 10 and 30 °C. 4.
Vehicle preparation 4.1.
Full fuel replenishment means that the fuel tank must be filled to not less than 90 per cent of its capacity. 4.3.
Determination of the measured initial inclination The vehicle shall be prepared as specified in paragraph 4 above and laden as specified in annex 5 (first loading condition of the respective vehicle category).
Measurements shall be made three times. 5.2.1.
If any measurement differs from the arithmetic mean of the results by more than 2 mrad (0.2 per cent inclination), a further series of 10 measurements shall be made, the arithmetic mean of which shall constitute the final result. 5.3.
M2, M3 and N category vehicles with conventional suspension 5.4.2.1.
Measurements The variation of the inclination of the dipped-beam shall be assessed for each of the different loading conditions in relation to the measured initial inclination determined in accordance with paragraph 5.2.
Requirements have been met if, for all the loading conditions, the variation in inclination is within the calculated limits (for example, within the difference between the stated initial inclination and the lower and upper limits specified for approval) with a safety margin of 4 mrad (0.4 per cent inclination). 5.5.2.
For each of the above loading conditions: 5.5.3.1.
If any measurement differs from the arithmetic mean of the results by more than 2 mrad (0.2 per cent inclination), a further series of 10 measurements shall be made, the arithmetic mean of which shall constitute the final result. 5.5.3.3.

Alternatively the manufacturer shall set the initial aim to a figure that is different from the plated figure where it can be shown to be representative of the type approved when tested in accordance with the procedures contained in annex 6 and in particular paragraph 4.1. 1.3.2.
The states of loading to be used shall be as follows, as indicated in annex 5 of this Regulation, for every system adjusted accordingly. 1.3.2.1.
Vehicles in category N without load surfaces: 1.3.2.4.1.
