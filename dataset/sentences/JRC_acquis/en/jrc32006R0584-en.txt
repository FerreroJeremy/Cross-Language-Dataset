Existing measures (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1480/2003 [3] (the definitive Regulation), the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty of 34,8 % on imports of certain electronic microcircuits known as dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung), for which a 0 % duty rate was established.
The definitive Regulation was preceded by Commission Regulation (EC) No 708/2003 of 23 April 2003 imposing a provisional countervailing duty on imports of certain electronic microcircuits known as DRAMs (dynamic random access memories) originating in the Republic of Korea [4] (provisional Regulation). (2) Two exporting producers located in the Republic of Korea cooperated in the investigation which led to the imposition of the existing measures (the original investigation): Samsung, which was not found receiving subsidies, and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (Hynix).
The European Community (EC) industry in the original investigation consisted of two producers which accounted for the major proportion of the total Community production of DRAMs, Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany (Infineon) and Micron Europe Ltd, Crowthorne, United Kingdom (Micron). (3) The investigation of subsidisation and injury covered the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001 (IP).
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 1998 to the end of the IP (the period under consideration). 2.
Report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO (4) On 3 August 2005, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTOmm) adopted a Panel report in "European Communities — Countervailing measures on dynamic random access memory chips from Korea" [5]. (5) According to the Panel report, the EC acted in a manner inconsistent with its WTO obligations under: (a) Article 1.1(a) of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures [6] (the SCM Agreement) in determining that the May 2001 restructuring programme constituted a financial contribution by the government; (b) Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement in its determination of the existence of a benefit in the case of the syndicated loan; (c) Articles 1.1(b) and 14 of the SCM Agreement in directly applying, for the purposes of the calculation of the amount of benefit, its grant methodology to all programmes found to constitute a subsidy; (d) Article 15.4 of the SCM Agreement by not evaluating the factor "wages" as a relevant factor affecting the state of the domestic industry; and (e) Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement by failing to make sure that the injury caused by certain other factors (in particular, decline in demand, overcapacity, and other (non-subsidised) imports) was not attributed to the subsidised imports. (6) On the other hand, the EC was found to have acted consistently with its WTO obligations under: (a) Article 1.1(a) of the SCM Agreement in determining that the syndicated loan, the KEIC guarantee, the KDB debenture programme and the October 2001 restructuring programme constituted a financial contribution by the Government of Korea (GOK); (b) Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement in determining that a benefit was conferred on Hynix by the KEIC guarantee, the KDB debenture programme, the May 2001 restructuring programme and the October 2001 restructuring programme; (c) Articles 1.2 and 2 of the SCM Agreement in finding de facto specificity (two Korean claims); (d) Article 15.2 of the SCM Agreement in assessing the significance of the volume and price effects of the subsidised imports (2 Korean claims); (e) Article 15.4 of the SCM Agreement in considering all factors relevant to the overall condition of the domestic industry, except for the factor "wages"; (f) Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement in demonstrating the requisite causal link between the subsidised imports and injury; and (g) Article 12.7 of the SCM Agreement in applying "facts available" with respect to the subsidy investigation. 3.
The product concerned also includes DRAMs presented in (non-customised) memory modules or (non-customised) memory boards, or in some other kind of aggregate form, provided the main purpose of which is to provide memory [7]. (10) The product concerned is currently classifiable within CN codes 85422111, 85422113, 85422115, 85422117, ex85422101, ex85422105, ex85489010, ex84733010 and ex84735010. (11) The Panel report did not cover any claims affecting the findings set out in the definitive Regulation concerning the product under consideration and the like product.
Introduction (12) This part sets out the reassessed findings based on the conclusions and recommendations of the Panel report concerning: (a) whether the May 2001 restructuring programme constituted a financial contribution by the GOK within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation; (b) whether there was a benefit in the case of the syndicated loan within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation; (c) the calculation of the amount of the benefit with regard to all subsidy programmes within the meaning of Articles 2(2) and 6 of the basic Regulation. (13) All other findings concerning subsidies remain as established in the original investigation and set out in the provisional Regulation and the definitive Regulation. 1.2.
May 2001 bond purchase by creditor banks in the amount of KRW 1 trillion and first roll-over of debt (restructuring programme) (14) The Panel found that the determination that the creditor banks were directed to participate in the May 2001 restructuring programme and that their purchase of KRW 1 trillion of convertible bonds (CBs) as part of the programme therefore constituted a financial contribution by the GOK was not consistent with Article 1.1(a) of the SCM Agreement [8].
However, the Panel found that the EC failed to establish the existence of a benefit from the financial contribution provided by the KDB and the KEB within the meaning of Article 1(b) of the SCM Agreement [12].
Specifically, the Panel stated that the EC had not examined whether there were comparable commercial loans that could actually have been obtained by Hynix on the market and stated that the EC had ignored the other participants in the syndicated loans as possible benchmarks [13]. (17) In the view of the Commission, the participation by the other banks in the syndicated loan cannot serve as a proper benchmark for determining the existence of a benefit.
As the Panel itself noted, in determining the existence of a commercial benchmark, authorities must examine whether such loans were so influenced by the alleged government intervention that they do not represent loans that could actually be obtained on the market [14].
In a high-level economic ministerial meeting in November 2000 the GOK took steps to "alleviate Hynix's cash crunch" and waived statutory credit limits for KFB, KEB and KDB.
However, given that the Panel found that the same GOK tactics employed in relation to KEB amounted to direction and that the GOK owns 49 % of KFB, it is reasonable to conclude that the GOK was in a position to and did exert influence over KFB in relation to its decision to participate in the syndicated loan.
KDB is a public body and KEB was found by the Panel to have been directed by the GOK.
The participation of these banks in the syndicated loan is thus not a reliable commercial benchmark.
In response, an FSS official criticised their move as "unthinkable" [18].
As a result of these threats, KorAm Bank capitulated and reversed its decision [21], while at the same time increasing its loan loss reserves for Hynix and offering no legitimate credit analysis for providing such financial assistance.
Of the remaining banks which participated in the syndicated loan, Chohung Bank, Woori Bank, the NACF, Seoul Bank, Kwangju Bank, Peace Bank, Kyongnam Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea are all GOK-owned and thus their credit decisions are tainted by GOK policy.
Given this degree of GOK control over Pusan Bank, the bank's decision to participate in the syndicated loan cannot be considered to be a safe commercial benchmark. (21) Third, it would clearly not be appropriate to use Citibank Seoul as a benchmark to determine the commercial reasonableness of participating in the syndicated loan, for the reasons set forth in recitals 130 to 133 of the definitive Regulation.
Third, Citibank itself was a financial advisor to Hynix regarding its restructuring and thus had an inherent conflict with respect to participation in new lending to Hynix [26].
As noted in recital 87 of the definitive Regulation, Hynix had not been servicing the syndicated loan that it received in January 2001. (23) Based on the foregoing, it may be concluded that none of the other seven participants in the syndicated loan can serve as an appropriate benchmark for measuring the commercial reasonableness or the amount of benefit to Hynix from the portions of the loan provided by KEB and KDB. (24) On this basis, the participation of KEB and KDB in the syndicated loan may still be considered to be a countervailable subsidy that provides a benefit to Hynix.
However, as set out in recital 37 of the definitive Regulation, no subsidy amount has been countervailed under the syndicated loan in order to avoid double-counting, as the syndicated loan amount was subsequently rolled-over into the October 2001 measures.
Calculation of the amount of benefit (25) The Panel found, at para. 7.215 of its report, that the calculation of the amount of the benefit conferred by each of the financial contributions was inconsistent with Articles 1.1(b) and 14 of the SCM Agreement.
Thus, the Panel report only addressed how the EC applied these provisions and calculated the amount of the benefit with respect to the measures at issue in this proceeding (the definitive Regulation). (26) In particular, the Panel considered that the EC acted inconsistently with Article 1.1(b) and 14 of the SCM Agreement by taking as a starting point that the amount of the benefit conferred by each of the financial contributions, which were generally in the form of loans, guarantees or equity, was to be calculated as if those financial contributions had been grants, irrespective of their terms and conditions.
It further reasoned that the provision in this case of funds to Hynix in the form of loans, guarantees and equity may have been of less benefit to Hynix than if the funds had been provided in the form of grants.
In particular, the Panel reasoned that the funds would appear as debt in Hynix's balance sheet or would have given rise to the dilution of the ownership claims of existing shareholders in Hynix [29]. (27) The Panel considered that, as a matter of WTO law, the correct starting point for the EC in this case must be the search for an alternative benchmark as a base for the calculation of the amount of benefit.
The Panel also referred, by way of example, to so-called "junk bonds" or "vulture funds" [30]. (28) The Panel observed that there may be circumstances in which there is an absence of any comparable benchmark, and that the investigating authority was and is entitled to considerable leeway in adopting a reasonable approach to calculating the amount of the benefit to Hynix [31]. (29) In the light of the Panel's findings, for each of the relevant financial contributions in the measure at issue, the Commission has re-examined all of the relevant facts and evidence on the record, taking into account all of the submissions of interested parties, specifically with respect to possible alternative benchmarks, including "junk bonds" and "vulture funds", and, for each relevant financial contribution, redetermined the amount of the benefit to Hynix. (30) The Commission has not re-examined or made any redeterminations with respect to any substantive or procedural matters confirmed by the Panel report or not found by the Panel to be inconsistent with the SCM Agreement, including, but not limited to: Hynix's financial situation or worth, conditions in the DRAM market, conditions in the financial markets and the use of facts available.
However, as regards the amount of the benefit, the Panel report indicates that the EC should, as a matter of WTO law, re-examine the question of the availability of alternative benchmarks for calculating the benefit to Hynix [36]. (35) As the Panel observed, the question of benefit in the case of a government guarantee can be examined from more than one angle [37]. (36) One reasonable method of enquiring into the amount of benefit from such a measure might be to compare the guarantee provided by the government with a comparable guarantee provided by the market [38]. (37) A second reasonable method is indicated by Article 6(b) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 14(b) of the SCM Agreement), which refers to government loans; and Article 6(c) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement), which refers to a loan guarantee by a government [39].
The financial contribution under consideration related to the extension of the facility by USD 600 million.
First, the Commission considered whether Hynix had received new loans at the time that the USD 600 million increase had been granted.
Second, the Commission looked for verified evidence regarding the cost and terms of a comparable commercial guarantee or a "comparable commercial loan absent the government guarantee" that Hynix or another firm in a situation comparable to Hynix concluded at the relevant time.
A comparable commercial loan would ideally be one of approximately the same size, would related to the same or a similar sector of economic activity, would involve a comparable type of activity, such as export credit insurance, and would have been concluded at approximately the same time.
It could not involve any government guarantee, express or implied, and would need to involve a firm in a comparable financial situation to that of Hynix. (39) Having conducted this re-examination, the Commission has determined that there is no reliable information on the record regarding these matters.
In any event, Citibank did not cooperate in the investigation. (40) Given Hynix's financial condition, there are no Hynix-specific benchmarks that can be used and there is no data on the record regarding loans to companies in a similar financial condition to Hynix.
The KEIC export credit guarantee programme and the KDB debenture programme were in effect throughout 2001.
At year-end 2000, Hynix's total indebtedness was KRW 8 trillion, and Hynix's current ratio, which measures the degree to which a firm's current assets cover current liabilities, was 0,33 [41].
Hynix's net profit margin fell from 2,08 % in 1999 to minus 24,03 % in 2000 (when the DRAM industry as a whole performed well) and minus 93,83 % in 2001 [42].
Clearly, during 2000 and 2001, Hynix was unable to generate adequate cash flow to cover its existing debt, much less new debt. (41) Market analysts agreed that Hynix was not creditworthy during this period.
Hynix's Standard %amp% Poor's rating was B- in March 2001, CCC+ in August 2001 and "selective default" in October 2001.
Accordingly, such information as is on the record does not permit the establishment of a reliable benchmark with respect to such markets. (44) The Commission would therefore be in a position to reasonably and objectively conclude that no alternative commercial benchmark would actually be available in this case.
The Commission believes that this conclusion is fully supported by its (unchanged) determinations regarding the financial situation and worth of Hynix, and the situation in the DRAMs market and the financial markets, and that it is consistent with the basic Regulation and the Guidelines. (45) However, mindful of the WTO Panel’s reasoning, the Commission has, exceptionally and for this reason only, also considered whether or not, even absent any relevant benchmarks, there is anything that might serve as the basis for a proxy benchmark, adjusted where necessary to take account of the particular circumstances of this case.
Essentially, this would entail taking an interest rate available in the market to creditworthy borrowers and adding a "risk premium" to it in order to account for the increased risk associated with lending to a company that is not creditworthy. (46) For purposes of implementing the Panel's report in this case, the Commission has used the following formula to calculate an appropriate uncreditworthy benchmark interest rate: ib= [(1-qn)(1+if)n/(1-pn)]1/n -1 Where: n = the term of the loan ib = the benchmark interest rate for an uncreditworthy borrower if = the long-term interest rate that would be paid by a creditworthy company pn = the probability of default by an uncreditworthy company within n years qn = the probability of default by a creditworthy company within n years. (47) For the purposes of this implementation, the Commission has used as the creditworthy (or commercial) rate for USD loans the average USD lending interest rate for 2001, which, according to the IMF International Financial Statistics Service, was 6,922 %.
Similarly, the Commission used the default rate for a creditworthy company during the term of the measure in question, calculated based on a cumulation of data for investment grade companies.
The rate of default of a creditworthy company in 2001 within one year was 0,13 %.
This led to total interest rate of 62,70 %.
In contrast, the interest rate payable by Hynix on the USD loans in question was 8,33 %, i.e., a total interest differential of 54,37 %. (48) The Commission recalls that, normally, having determined that the benefit is equivalent to the full amount of the financial contribution (in this case, a loan or loan guarantee), the Commission treats it as a "non-recurring" subsidy and allocates it over a period of time corresponding to the normal depreciation of fixed assets in the industry concerned.
In this case, the allocation period was five years and no additional costs were added to the full amount of the loan as explained in recital 44 above, which means that 20 % of the financial contribution was allocated to each year. (49) Had the Commission used an interest rate comparison as described in recitals 45 to 47 above, the benefit (i.e., the difference between the benchmark and the actual interest rate) would have been considered as a recurring subsidy.
The amount of subsidy allocated to each year would have been the interest rate differential multiplied by the fact amount of the loan.
Therefore, depending on the size of the interest rate differential, the terms and conditions of the loan, and the length of the depreciation period, the annual benefit obtained by making an interest rate comparison may be bigger or smaller than that which results from the application of the Commission’s original approach. (50) In this case, the Commission's original approach would result in an allocated annual benefit of 20 % of the financial contribution.
Depending on the exact terms of the loan, i.e., whether the beneficiary repays interest and capital or interest only each year, this amount would be reached with an interest rate differential of no less than 20 % and no more than about 35 % per year.
This means that a strict application of this method would result in a much higher rate of countervailable subsidy allocated on turnover, in fact 12,8 % instead of the 5,1 % originally calculated by the Commission. (51) Consequently, the Commission considers that its original approach was and is reasonable in this case.
Therefore, the interest rate differential will often give a higher amount of benefit than a simple allocation of the face amount of the loan over time.
In these circumstances, the Commission has used the more conservative of the two options in order to be sure that it has not exaggerated the amount of the subsidy, and will treat the face amount of the loan as the basis for a cap on the maximum amount of the benefit. (52) On the above basis, the amount of benefit conferred by the KEIC guarantee ad valorem of export turnover was 5,1 %. 1.6.
A participating company repaid on its own 20 % of its corporate bonds falling due and the KDB assumed the remaining 80 %.
Of the 80 % originally assumed by the KDB, 20 % of the bonds was then sold to the company's creditor banks in proportion to their debt exposure to the company; 70 % was re-packaged for sale to investors as collateralised bond obligations (CBOs) and/or collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), guaranteed by the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) [49]; and the KDB retained the remaining 10 %.
The CFIC consisted of representatives of the KCGF, the KDB and 17 other creditor banks [51].
If banks holding 75 % of the loans of the company agreed to the participation of the company in the programme, the CFIC considered the decision unanimous.
To be placed in the programme, companies had to be able to repay 20 % of their maturing bonds; normalise business operations through a rescue plan; have credit ratings below A but higher than BB; and agree to any change in majority shareholdings requested by their creditor banks, or to the replacement of management in case of insolvency.
Hynix was admitted to the programme on 4 January 2001 with a credit rating of BBB-.
The EC found that the bond purchase by the KDB as part of this programme constituted a financial contribution by the government which conferred a benefit on Hynix. (54) The Panel found that the EC reached a reasonable and reasoned conclusion on the basis of the record before it that the KDB debenture programme conferred a benefit on Hynix.
However, as regards the amount of the benefit, the Panel report indicates that the Commission should, as a matter of WTO law, re-examine the question of the availability of alternative benchmarks. (55) As the Panel observed, the question of benefit, at least in the case of a government guarantee, can be examined from more than one angle [55], and in applying the guidelines contained in Article 14 of the SCM Agreement, an investigating authority is entitled to considerable leeway [56].
Thus, one reasonable method of enquiring into the amount of benefit of such a measure might be to compare the guarantee provided by the government with a comparable guarantee provided by the market.
The KDB debenture programme might also be considered in the light of Article 6(b) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 14(b) of the SCM Agreement), which refers to government loans, and Article 6(c) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 14(c) of the SCM Agreement), which refers to a loan guarantee by a government. (56) The Commission has re-examined the record to consider whether there is any relevant benchmark against which the amount of the benefit could be calculated.
It has looked for verified evidence about a comparable government guarantee or "a comparable commercial loan" or "a comparable commercial loan absent the government guarantee" that Hynix or another firm in a situation comparable to Hynix concluded at the relevant time.
A comparable commercial loan would ideally be one of approximately the same size, would relate to the same or a similar sector of economic activity, would involve a comparable type of activity, and would have been concluded at approximately the same time.
It could not involve any government guarantee, express or implied, and would need to involve a firm in a comparable financial situation to that of Hynix. (57) Having conducted this re-examination, the Commission has determined that a commercial benchmark meeting these criteria was not available in this case.
In fact, one of the threshold criteria for participation in the KDB debenture programme was that the company in question could not obtain loans or sell bonds on the normal commercial market.
Even the Korean government itself noted in January 2001 that Hynix was "in a state of technical insolvency." [57]. (58) Moreover, other lending to Hynix during the period that the KDB rolled over Hynix’s maturing bonds cannot serve as a basis for measuring whether a benefit to Hynix exists.
For the reasons noted in recitals 17 to 22 above, the loans provided as part of the syndicated loan cannot serve as an appropriate basis of comparison.
Without the participation of these three banks in the syndicate, it is unclear whether the loan would have been able to go forward at all, given that it would have been significantly undersubscribed [58]. (59) Further, the convertible bonds purchased by private bodies as part of the May 2001 restructuring programme cannot serve as a benchmark because, although the evidence on record did not rise to the level sufficient for a finding of entrustment or direction, it indicates a level of government involvement that makes the participation by private creditors an inappropriate measure of the commercial reasonableness of the CB purchases: the creditor banks themselves acknowledged in the 7 May 2001 creditor financial institution resolution that Hynix was unable to service its debts in May 2001 [59] and the GOK was clearly heavily involved in overseeing the completion of the May 2001 CB offering, going as far as having a high level FSS official attend the March 2001 meeting of the creditor council [60].
Further, a comparable commercial loan which could serve as a benchmark is one which is concluded at approximately the same period of time; the CB offering took place five months after the KDB debenture programme, when both Hynix's financial situation and the state of the DRAMs market were markedly different. (60) As already indicated above [61], no other comparable commercial benchmark was actually available in the market.
On the contrary, the available information indicates Hynix would not have obtained the relevant funds in the market. (61) The Commission would therefore be in a position to reasonably and objectively conclude that no alternative commercial benchmark would actually be available in this case.
Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Commission finds that the amount of the benefit to Hynix could not exceed the full amount of the funds obtained by Hynix as a result of the operation of the KDB debenture programme, plus compound interest and the costs of recovery or attempted recovery in the event of default.
The Commission believes that this conclusion is fully supported by its (unchanged) determinations regarding the financial situation and worth of Hynix, and the situation in the DRAMs market and the financial markets, and that it is consistent with the basic Regulation and the Guidelines. (62) However, mindful of the WTO Panel's reasoning, the Commission has also considered whether or not, even without the availability of any appropriate commercial benchmarks, there is anything that might serve as the basis for a proxy benchmark, adjusted where necessary to take account of the particular circumstances of this case.
Such a proxy could, for example, be calculated along the lines already indicated above in recitals 45 and 46 with respect to the KEIC Guarantee. (63) For the purposes of this calculation, and as suggested by GOK, the Commission has used as the creditworthy rate for KRW loans the IMF International Financial Statistics rate on short-term KRW denominated-lending, which was 7,7 %.
In contrast, the average interest rate payable by Hynix on the KDB debentures in question was 12,7 %, i.e., a total interest rate differential of 51,19 %. (64) Viewing the financial contribution as a recurring subsidy, rather than as a non-recurring subsidy to be allocated over time, and applying this model to the calculation of the amount of the benefit in the financial contribution under consideration, would lead to an amount of benefit of KRW 626,9 billion, resulting in a countervailable subsidy allocated on turnover of 11,8 %, instead of the 4,9 % originally calculated by the Commission.
Consequently, the Commission considers that its original approach was and is reasonable in this case, as the interest rate differential would give a much higher amount of benefit than a simple allocation of the face amount of the loan over time.
In these circumstances, the Commission has used the more conservative of the two options in order to be sure that it has not exaggerated the amount of the subsidy and will treat the face amount of the loan as the basis for a cap on the maximum amount of the benefit. (65) Taking the amount of the funds obtained by Hynix as a result of the operation of the KDB debenture programme as a cap on the maximum amount of the benefit, the Commission finds that the amount of benefit to Hynix in the financial contribution at issue ad valorem of turnover was 4,9 %. 1.7.
The CFIC consisted of 110 financial institutions including 17 banks and 15 investment trust companies.
The decisions of the CFIC were taken by a 75 % majority.
These so-called Option 1 banks were the KEB, Woori Bank, Chohung Bank, KDB, NACF and Citibank [62].
The EC considered that the participation by the six Option 1 banks in the October 2001 restructuring programme constituted a financial contribution by the government which conferred a benefit on Hynix.
The rate of subsidisation for this October 2001 restructuring programme was calculated to be 19,4 %. (67) The Panel found that the EC reached a reasonable and reasoned conclusion on the basis of the record before it that the October 2001 restructuring programme conferred a benefit on Hynix [64].
It has looked for verified evidence about a comparable private provision of equity capital that Hynix or another firm in a situation comparable to Hynix concluded at the relevant time.
A comparable provision of equity ideally would be one of approximately the same size, would relate to the same or a similar sector of economic activity, would involve a comparable type of activity and would have been concluded at approximately the same time.
It could not involve any government guarantee, express or implied, and would need to involve a firm in a comparable financial situation to that of Hynix. (70) Having conducted this re-examination, the Commission has determined that there is no verified information on the record regarding these matters.
As noted in recital 103 of the definitive Regulation, in October 2001 Hynix's credit rating from Standard %amp% Poor’s was "SD" (selective default).
The conclusions set out in recitals 101 to 112 of the definitive Regulation supporting the finding that no comparable equity financing that might serve as a benchmark was available to Hynix on the commercial market are hereby confirmed. (72) The Commission would therefore be in a position to reasonably and objectively conclude that no alternative commercial benchmark would actually be available in this case.
Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Commission finds that the amount of the benefit to Hynix could not exceed the full amount of the funds obtained by Hynix as a result of the operation of the debt to equity swap in the October 2001 restructuring programme.
It has looked for verified evidence about a comparable commercial loan that Hynix or another firm in a situation comparable to Hynix concluded at the relevant time.
A comparable commercial loan ideally would be one of approximately the same size, would relate to the same or a similar sector of economic activity, would involve a comparable type of activity, and would have been concluded at approximately the same time.
It could not involve any government guarantee, express or implied, and would need to involve a firm in a comparable financial situation to that of Hynix. (80) The bonds purchased as part of the May 2001 restructuring programme cannot serve as a basis for determining the commercial reasonableness of the new loan and the debt roll-over, as Hynix's financial situation deteriorated substantially between May and October 2001.
Therefore, the two situations cannot be considered to be comparable. (81) Having conducted this re-examination, the Commission has determined that there is no verified information on the record regarding these matters.
The loans provided to Hynix were generally either provided by the GOK or by banks that were entrusted or directed by the GOK. (82) As already indicated above [67], no other comparable commercial benchmark was actually available in the market.
On the contrary, the available information indicates Hynix could not have obtained the relevant funds in the market. (83) The Commission would therefore be in a position to reasonably and objectively conclude that no alternative commercial benchmark would actually be available in this case.
Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Commission finds that the amount of the benefit to Hynix could not exceed the full amount of the funds obtained by Hynix as a result of the operation of the debt roll-over and new loan in the October 2001 restructuring programme.
The rate of default of an uncreditworthy company in 2001 within three years (the term of the new loan and of the roll-over) was 57,97 %, whereas the rate of default of a creditworthy company within three years in 2001 was 0,94 %.
In contrast, the interest rate payable by Hynix on the new loan was 7 % and on the roll-over 6,5 %, i.e., an interest rate differential of 41,2 % and 41,7 % respectively. (86) Viewing the financial contributions as recurring subsidies, rather than as non-recurring subsidies to be allocated over time, and applying this model to the calculation of the amount of the benefit in the financial contributions under consideration, would lead to an amount of benefit of KRW 271,5 billion for the new loan and KRW 761,4 billion for the roll-over.
This would result in countervailable subsidies allocated on turnover of 6,8 % for the new loan and 19,1 % for the roll-over, compared to 3,5 % and 9,8 % respectively, as originally calculated by the Commission.
Consequently, the Commission considers that its original approach was and is reasonable in this case, as the interest rate differential would give a much higher amount of benefit than a simple allocation of the face amount of the loans over time.
The revised amount expressed ad valorem is 22,9 %. 1.8.
Total subsidy amount (89) In summary, the calculation of the total amount of the subsidy has thus been revised on the basis of the Panel's recommendations and is now as follows: Type of subsidy | D/A extension | KDB debenture programme | May 2001 CB purchase, debt roll-over | October 2001 rescue package | Total | — | 5,1 % | 4,9 % | 0 % | 22,9 % | 32,9 % | 2.
Introduction (90) This part sets out the reassessed findings based on the recommendation of the Panel report concerning the evaluation of the factor "wages" as a relevant factor affecting the state of the Community industry within the meaning of Article 8(5) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 15.4 of the SCM Agreement). (91) All other findings concerning injury remain as established in the original investigation and set out in the provisional Regulation and the definitive Regulation. 2.2.
Average cost for wages per employee | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 (IP) | Index | 100 | 99 | 115 | 109 | (95) The table shows that the average cost of the Community industry for wages and salaries during the period under consideration varied, decreasing and increasing over time.
In 2000, it increased by 15 %.
Consequently, this relatively small increase in wages had hardly any effect on the overall financial situation of the Community industry. (97) Given its negligible impact, consideration of the wages factor together with the other factors referred to in Article 8(5) of the basic Regulation is not such as to alter the conclusion that the Community industry suffered material injury [73]. 2.3.
Conclusion (98) Based on the foregoing, the conclusion set out in recital 188 of the definitive Regulation that the Community industry suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 8 of the basic Regulation is hereby confirmed. 3.
The Panel's determination in paragraph 7.437 of its report does not preclude a conclusion of a causal relationship between subsidised imports and the material injury suffered by the Community industry, but added that a satisfactory explanation of the nature and extent of the injurious effects of those other factors, preferably with quantitative analysis, as distinguished from the effects of the subsidised imports, is required. 3.2.
One of the factors referred to is "contraction in demand". (101) The Panel found in paragraph 8.1(e) of its report that the EC had failed to make sure that the injury caused by "decline in demand" was not attributed to the subsidised imports.
EC consumption | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 (IP) | DRAMs in ’000 Mbits | 16593400 | 28961100 | 45873600 | 68967600 | Index | 100 | 175 | 276 | 416 | (102) The Commission recalls that, all other things being equal, demand (i.e., the willingness and ability to obtain an amount of a particular good) may generally be considered to be equivalent to consumption (i.e., the actual physical process of using a good irrespective of the level of trade).
On the contrary, the subsidised imports had a significant impact on the prices of the Community industry and, thus, on its injurious condition (see recitals 191 and 192 of the definitive Regulation). (103) Hynix and the GOK noted that worldwide demand for DRAMs grew in 2001 by only 59 % compared to the average year on year growth rate of 75 %, apparently contending that in 2000 to 2001 there was a huge slowdown in the growth rate of demand (see recital 193 of the definitive Regulation).
Hynix and the GOK correctly point out that the DRAMs market is cyclical (see recital 193 of the definitive Regulation).
Accordingly, record evidence does not support the conclusion that in 2000 to 2001 the growth rate of demand slowed down significantly, considering the cyclical nature of the DRAMs market. (104) It was also considered whether the growth rate of demand in the Community slowed down in 2000 to 2001 as compared to the actual growth rates observed in previous years.
The demand for DRAMs in the Community, measured in terms of EC consumption, increased by 75 % in 1998 to 1999, 58 % in 1999 to 2000 and 51 % in 2000 to 2001.
Thus, while there was a constant increase in demand during the period under consideration, this increase followed a declining trend.
Nevertheless, demand growth rate remained significant in the IP (51 %). (105) The declining trend in demand growth was more pronounced between 1999 and 2000 (where demand growth declined by 17 percentage points) than between 2000 and the IP (where demand growth declined by 8 percentage points).
This evolution of demand growth has to be assessed by comparison with the evolution of the sales prices of the Community industry, the primary cause of injury to the Community industry during the period under consideration (see recital 188 of the definitive Regulation).
In particular, in 1999 to 2000, demand growth declined by a sizable 23 %, but the average sales price of the Community industry dropped by only 5 %.
Similarly, while the Panel concluded that the investigating authority’s finding, in respect of stainless steel bar, concerning demand as a factor of injury, did not satisfy the non-attribution requirement, the Panel noted that the investigating authority could have met this requirement, through a "reasoned and adequate explanation", simply by showing that trends in demand had no connection with trends in a key variable attesting to the condition of the domestic industry [75]. (107) Accordingly, the Commission is of the view that its redetermination satisfies the non-attribution requirement under Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement) in respect of demand growth by showing that, during the period under consideration, trends in demand growth were independent from trends in the sales prices of the Community industry.
Overcapacity (108) The Panel noted in paragraph 7.421 of its report that the question of separating and distinguishing the effects of overcapacity in driving prices down should be addressed, irrespective of who is to blame for such overcapacity. (109) The Commission notes that "overcapacity" is not expressly referred to in Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement).
The Commission considers both situations below. (111) As set out in recital 153 of the provisional Regulation and recital 197 of the definitive Regulation, some overcapacity existed worldwide during a number of years including the period under consideration.
This finding has not been disputed by any party concerned. (112) However, as set out in recital 147 of the provisional Regulation, the worldwide overcapacity was estimated to be approximately 20 % of the market.
Hynix accounted for around 17 % of worldwide production during the IP.
Their total production in Mbits increased in line by 124 % between 1999 and 2000 and by 81 % between 2000 and the IP.
In other words, the capacity and the production of the four major worldwide producers increased significantly more between 1999 and 2000, the good year during which the Community industry maintained some price stability and made profits, than between 2000 and the IP (2001), during which the Community industry suffered significant losses because of the collapse of prices (see recitals 128 and 131 and relevant tables of the provisional Regulation).
Consequently, the existing worldwide overcapacity throughout the period under consideration did not, in the Commission’s view, contribute significantly to the collapse of prices and the material injury suffered by the Community industry in the IP. (114) In addition, record evidence shows that Community overcapacity was not a factor of injury.
During 1999 to 2000, Community capacity more than tripled (increasing by 252 %), and from 2000 to 2001 it nearly doubled (increasing by 92 %).
While capacity utilisation in the Community did drop by 28 % from 1999 to 2000, it recovered by 4 % from 2000 to 2001 (see recital 125 and relevant table of the provisional Regulation). (115) Trends in Community overcapacity (defined as the inverse of Community capacity utilisation) show little or no correlation with trends in the sales prices of the Community industry.
In particular, during 1999 to 2000, Community overcapacity rose by 28 %, but the sales prices of the Community industry fell by only 5 %.
Further, from 2000 to 2001, Community overcapacity went down by 4 % but the sales prices of the Community industry plummeted by 77 % (see recitals 125 and 128 and relevant tables of the provisional Regulation).
This stands in sharp contrast with the close correlation between trends in the prices of the subsidised imports and trends in the sales prices of the Community industry.
In fact, during 2000 to 2001 the trend in the sales prices of the Community industry mirrored almost perfectly the trend in the prices of the subsidised imports: over this period, the former dropped by 74 % and the latter did so by 77 % (see recitals 119 and 128 of the provisional Regulation). (116) Record evidence also shows that trends in Community overcapacity bear no correlation with trends in other key indicators of the condition of the Community industry.
In contrast, in 2001 the Community industry suffered heavy losses, and returns on investment and cash flow were negative, in spite of the contraction in Community overcapacity during 2000 and 2001.
The performance of the Community industry over 2000 to 2001 in terms of profitability, returns on investment and cash flow is correlated instead with the trend in the prices of the subsidised imports over that period.
As noted, in 2000 to 2001, as the Community industry suffered heavy losses and negative cash flow and return on investment, the prices of the subsidised imports decreased by 74 %. (117) Hynix claimed that Community overcapacity was another known factor contributing to material injury during the period under consideration.
The Commission believes this finding is consistent with the findings of recent WTO Panels reviewing determinations in respect of non-attribution described in recital 106 above. (118) As reviewed, there is no demonstrated causal relationship between overcapacity and either price declines or injury to the Community industry.
Given the very limited number of players in the DRAMs market, for reasons of confidentiality, indices are used to show the evolution of trends. | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 (IP) | Non-subsidised imports in ’000 Mbits | 100 | 142 | 166 | 233 | Market share of non-subsidised imports | 100 | 81 | 60 | 56 | Average price of non-subsidised imports | 100 | 89 | 104 | 48 | (120) During the period under consideration, non-subsidised imports increased significantly less than did subsidised imports, i.e., by 133 % as opposed to 361 % (see recital 177 and relevant table of the definitive Regulation).
Accordingly, during the period under consideration, the market share of non-subsidised imports contracted by 44 % whilst the market share of subsidised imports expanded by 20 % (see recital 185 and relevant table of the definitive Regulation).
In particular, during the IP the average price of non-subsidised imports was 19 % higher than the average price of subsidised imports and 24 % higher than the average sales price of the Community industry.
This contrast establishes that subject import volumes and price effects are a separate and distinguishable cause of material injury to the Community industry as compared with non-subject imports. (123) Therefore, the Commission is of the view that its redetermination satisfies the non-attribution requirement under Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation (which generally corresponds to Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement) in respect of non-subject imports by separating and distinguishing this other factor from subsidised imports and showing that, during the period under consideration, non-subject imports did not cause material injury to the Community industry, either in terms of their volume effects or in terms of their price effects. 3.5.
Furthermore, it is confirmed that the subsidised imports through the effects set out in recitals 144 to 149 of the provisional Regulation and recitals 191 and 192 of the definitive Regulation have caused material injury to the Community industry within the meaning of Article 8(6) of the basic Regulation. 4.
Community interest (125) The contents and conclusions reached in recitals 206 to 209 of the definitive Regulation remain unaffected by the Panel report.
The GOK specifically submits that the Commission should have used seven banks in the syndicated loan as a benchmark.
The Commission disagrees, particularly for the reasons set out in recitals 16 to 24 above.
In the light of the GOK’s comments the Commission has made some adjustments to its calculations, as reflected in this Regulation.
Nothing in the relevant legal rules obliges the Commission to apply the revised duty retroactively, the Panel limiting itself to recommending that the measure be brought in conformity, which is achieved by the present Regulation. (131) Infineon substantially agrees with the redetermination.
The Commission has carefully considered that request.
However, for the reasons set out in this Regulation and due to the specific purpose of this Regulation, notably as an implementation of the Panel's recommendations, the Commission has not altered its initial determination on this point. (132) Micron also substantially agrees with the redetermination, referring in this respect to facts and evidence that tend to confirm and corroborate the Commission’s conclusions, including an expert report prepared by Professor J.
However, as noted in this Regulation, the May 2001 restructuring programme would not in any event be countervailed, given that the largest proportion of the benefit would have been accounted for in the October 2001 measures.
The rate of the definitive countervailing duty applicable to the net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, shall be as follows: Korean producers | Rate of duty (%) | TARIC additional code | Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) 24th Fl., Samsung Main Bldg 250, 2-Ga, Taepyeong-Ro Jung-Gu, Seoul | 0 % | A437 | Hynix Semiconductor Inc. 891, Daechidong Kangnamgu, Seoul | 32,9 % | A693 | All other companies | 32,9 % | A999 | 3.
Upon presentation to the Member State’s customs authorities of the customs declaration for release into free circulation of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, the declarant shall indicate in box 44 of the Single Administrative Document (SAD) the reference number corresponding to the below product/origin descriptions indicated in the following table.
In such cases, the countervailing duty rate applicable to multi-combinational forms of DRAMs shall be calculated on the basis of the percentage represented by the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea out of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational forms of DRAM, as established in the table contained in paragraph 3, numbers 2 to 7.
