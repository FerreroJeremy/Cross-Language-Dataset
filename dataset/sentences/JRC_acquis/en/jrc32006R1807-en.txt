The validity of Regulation (EC) No 1614/2000 has been extended until 31 December 2006. (4) By letter dated 29 June 2006 Cambodia submitted a request for prolongation of the derogation in accordance with Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (5) When the validity of Regulation (EC) No 1614/2000 was extended until 31 December 2006, it was expected that new, simpler and more development-friendly GSP rules of origin would be in force before expiry of the derogation.
In addition, the interests of traders concluding contracts both in Cambodia and in the Community, as well as the stability of Cambodian industry, require that the derogation should be prolonged for a period sufficient to permit the continuation or conclusion of longer term contracts. (8) The derogation should therefore be prolonged until 31 December 2008.
It shall apply from 1 January 2007.
