Council Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing for 2006 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required Council Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing for 2006 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas [2], and in particular Article 2 thereof, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks [3], and in particular Articles 6 and 8 thereof, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 811/2004 of 21 April 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of the Northern hake stock [4], and in particular Article 5 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Whereas: (1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). (2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council, to establish the total allowable catches (TAC) by fishery or group of fisheries.
In that context, the ICCAT adopted a Decision observing that during the year 2004, the Community had under-exploited its quota for several stocks. (11) In order to respect the adjustments to the Community quotas established by the ICCAT, it is necessary for the distribution of the fishing opportunities arising from the under-utilisation to be carried out on the basis of the respective contribution of each Member State towards the under-utilisation without modifying the distribution key established in this Regulation concerning the annual allocation of TACs. (12) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with the Community legislation on the subject, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels [8], Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish [9], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy [10], Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources [11], Council Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 of 27 June 1994 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean [12], Council Regulation (EC) No 1627/94 of 27 June 1994 laying down general provisions concerning special fishing permits [13], Council Regulation (EC) No 601/2004 of 22 March 2004 laying down certain control measures applicable to fishing activities in the area covered by the Convention on the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources [14], Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms [15], Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States in the north-east Atlantic [16], Council Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 of 29 June 1998 specifying conditions under which herring may be landed for industrial purposes other than direct human consumption [17], Council Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks [18], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems [19], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels [20], Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species [21], Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep -sea stocks [22] and Council Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 of 22 December 2004 fixing for 2005 and 2006 the fishing opportunities for Community fishing vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks [23]. (13) It is necessary, following the advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), to apply a temporary system to manage the catch limits of anchovy in Subarea VIII. (14) It is necessary, following the advice from the ICES, to apply a temporary system to manage the fishing effort on sandeel in ICES Subarea IV and Division IIIa North. (15) Having regard to the scientific knowledge as to the biological status of the blue whiting stock, and following the negotiations between the Coastal States on the management of that stock, it is necessary to modify the management areas while taking into account the specific characteristics of the fisheries concerned. (16) As a transitional measure in the light of the most recent scientific advice from the ICES, the fishing effort on certain deep-sea species should be further reduced. (17) For the adjustment of fishing effort limitations on cod as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 alternative arrangements are proposed in order to manage fishing effort consistently with the TAC, as laid down in Article 8(3) of the said Regulation. (18) Scientific advice indicates that the stock of North Sea plaice is not fished sustainably and that levels of discards are very high.
For the cod stocks in the Kattegat, in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Western channel, in the Irish Sea and in the west of Scotland, and the stocks of hake and of Norway lobster in ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa, the effort management scheme needs to be adapted. (20) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 does not ensure that the catches of herring are limited to the catch limits fixed for the species.
This recommendation should be implemented by the Community. (24) In order to contribute to the conservation of octopus and in particular to protect the juveniles, it is necessary to establish, in 2006, a minimum size of octopus from the maritime waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of third countries and situated in the CECAF region pending the adoption of a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98. (25) In November 2005 the NEAFC recommended placing a number of vessels on the list of vessels that have been confirmed as having engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries.
CCAMLR also approved the participation of Community vessels in exploratory fisheries for Dissostichus spp.

Obligations of the Member States Each Member State shall ensure that, when carrying on board any of the fishing gears referred to in point 4, fishing vessels flying its flag and registered in the Community shall be present within an area defined in point 2 for no more than the number of days set out in point 8. 6.
A Member State shall not permit fishing with a gear defined in point 4 in any areas defined in point 2 by any vessels flying its flag which have no record of such fishing activity in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 or 2005 in that area excluding the record of fishing activities as a result of transfer of days between fishing vessels unless it ensures that equivalent capacity, measured in kilowatts, is prevented from fishing in the area in question.
Calculation of fishing effort A Member State shall not count against the days present within an area allocated to any of vessels flying its flag under this Annex any days when the vessel was present within an area but unable to fish because it was assisting another vessel in need of emergency aid nor any days when the vessel has been present within an area but unable to fish because it is transporting an injured person for emergency medical aid.
The maximum number of days per year for which a vessel may be present within any combination of areas defined in point 2 may not be higher than the highest number of days allocated for one of the areas composing it. 8.4.
Management periods 9.1.
The number of days for which a vessel may be present within any of the areas defined in point 2 during a management period shall be fixed at the discretion of the Member State concerned. 9.3.
An additional number of days on which a vessel may be present within the area when carrying on board any of the gears referred to in point 4 may be allocated to Member States by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place since 1 January 2002 either in accordance with Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector [1] or resulting from other circumstances duly motivated by Member States.
The effort expended in 2001 measured in kilowatt days of the withdrawn vessels using the gear in question shall be compared to comparable level of effort expended by all vessels using that gear during 2001.
This point shall not apply where a vessel has been replaced in accordance with point 6.2. 10.2.
