Measures in force (1) In January 1997, Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97[2] imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms (RBM') originating, inter alia, in the People's Republic of China (PRC' or country concerned').
The rate of the definitive duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, was 32.5% for World Wide Stationery Mfg (WWS'), a company which was granted individual treatment and 39.4% for all other companies in the PRC.
These rates of duty were applicable to RBM other than those with 17 or 23 rings (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 11, 8305 10 00 12 and 8305 10 00 19), while RBM with 17 and 23 rings (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 21, 8305 10 00 22 and 8305 10 00 29) were subject to a duty equal to the difference between the minimum import price (MIP') of EUR 325 per 1000 pieces and the free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, whenever the latter was lower than the MIP. (2) In September 2000, following a request for an anti-absorption review of the above-mentioned measures, lodged pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation, the rates of duty applicable to RBM other than those with 17 or 23 rings (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 11, 8305 10 00 12 and 8305 10 00 19) were revised upwards by Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000[3] to 51.2% for WWS and to 78.8% for all other companies in the PRC. (3) Anti-dumping and countervailing measures are in force since June 2002 on imports of RBM originating in Indonesia.
These measures, which are not subject to the current review, were imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 976/2002 and Council Regulation (EC) No 977/2002 of 4 June 2002[4], respectively. (4) Following an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97 by imports of RBM consigned from Vietnam, the measures were extended to imports consigned from Vietnam by Council Regulation (EC) No 1208/2004[5]. (5) An investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97 by imports of RBM consigned from Thailand, whether declared as originating in Thailand or not, was initiated in April 2004[6]. (6) Both investigations mentioned in the previous two recitals were independent of the results of the present investigation. 2.
Request for a review (7) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of certain RBM originating in the PRC[7], the Commission received, on 23 October 2001, a request to review these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. (8) The request was lodged by two Community producers, Koloman Handler AG and Krause Ringbuchtechnik GmbH (the applicants'), representing a major proportion of the total Community production of RBM.
In addition, one producer in India (analogue country) was contacted and received a questionnaire. (13) Replies to the questionnaires were received from the two applicant Community producers and one exporting producer in the country concerned, as well as from one producer in the analogue country and two unrelated importers in the Community. (14) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: (i) Applicant Community producers - Krause Ringbuchtechnik GmbH, Espelkamp, Germany - SX Bürowaren Produktions- und Handels GmbH (until November 2001 RBM had been manufactured by Koloman Handler AG), Vienna, Austria (see recital (50)), (ii) Producer in the exporting country - World Wide Stationery Mfg, Hong Kong, PRC (iii) Producer in the analogue country - Tocheunglee Stationery Manufacturing Co, Chennai, India (iv) Unrelated importer in the Community - Bensons International Systems B.V., Utrecht, the Netherlands (c) Investigation period (16) The investigation on the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001 (investigation period' or IP').
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 1998 up to the end of the IP (period considered').
RBM are currently classified within CN code ex 8305 10 00 (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 11, 8305 10 00 12 and 8305 10 00 19 for mechanisms other than those with 17 or 23 rings and TARIC codes 8305 10 00 21, 8305 10 00 22 and 8305 10 00 29 for mechanisms with 17 and 23 rings).
C.LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OR RECURRENCE OF DUMPING (23) In accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the existing measures would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping. 1.
Indeed, most of the direct exports from the PRC during the IP of the current investigation covered %quot%niche segments%quot% such as 17 and 23 ring mechanisms subject to the MIP. (f) Dumping margin (33) In accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the weighted average normal value was compared with the weighted average export price, at the same level of trade.
The exports direct from the PRC by WWS were also centred on the top end of the range of RBM, in particular 17 and 23 ring models subject to a duty in the form of a MIP (see recital (32) above).
Recurrence of dumping (35) In the absence of a clear conclusion of continuation of dumping, the question of likelihood of a recurrence of dumping was investigated. (36) In this respect, the following elements were analysed: (a) the spare capacity and investments of the exporting Chinese producers; (b) the behaviour of the co-operating Chinese exporting producer on third country markets; (c) the structure in volume and prices of the exports of the product concerned to third countries by the non co-operating companies. (a) Spare capacity and investments (37) It is worth recalling that, in the absence of co-operation from exporting producers other than WWS, no information concerning production in the PRC, spare production capacity and sales on the Chinese market was available, except for the co-operating producer. (38) The production capacity of the co-operating company remained stable from 1999 to the IP.
However, since the production of the product concerned fell by 28% between 1999 and the IP, it is likely that the co-operating exporting producer has a significant unused production capacity, i.e.
It can also be reasonably assumed that the other Chinese producers also have significant spare capacities, as overall Chinese exports have decreased and there is no information showing that capacity in the PRC has declined. (39) It is noted that the co-operating company maintained a high level of investment in machinery and equipment from 1999 to the IP, although to a gradually decreasing extent. (b) Behaviour of the co-operating Chinese exporting producer on third country markets (40) Export sales to third countries (excluding the Community) by the co-operating company decreased by 8% in volume from 2000 to the IP.
Its average export price to third countries decreased by 12% during the same period. (c) Behaviour of non co-operating Chinese companies (volume and prices) (41) With regard to the companies which did not co-operate in the present investigation, findings had to be based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Even if the absolute volume of the Chinese exports differs according to the source of information, both statistics confirm that there was a significant decrease in RBM exports from China in the period between 1999 and the IP all over the world.
According to Chinese statistics, the volume of RBM exported in 1999 to the world market was around 662 million pieces, which decreased to 523 million pieces during the IP.
In these circumstances, it is reasonable to consider that if the anti-dumping measures were allowed to expire, the Community market would become a very attractive target for these Chinese exporters, who would then resume their exports to the Community market in considerable quantities. (42) Furthermore, it is important to note that OLAF carried out an investigation to determine whether imported RBM declared as originating in Thailand did actually originate in that country or, as it is alleged, were actually of PRC origin. (43) Investigations by OLAF and the Member States concerned have concluded that the RBM were not of Thai origin.
However, the calculation appeared to show that the export prices of the RBM exported from Thailand were lower than the prices on the Indian domestic market, and therefore it cannot be excluded that these RBM were sold to the Community at dumped prices. (d) Anti-absorption investigation (45) In addition, it should be recalled that in October 2000, following the original investigation which imposed a duty of 32.5% for WWS and 39.4% for all other Chinese companies, an anti-absorption investigation led to an increase in the level of duty to 51.2% for WWS and 78.8% for all other companies. (e) Trade defence measures applied by third countries (46) No third countries apply trade defence measures to imports of RBM from the PRC. 4.
Conclusion (47) The investigation has shown that both the co-operating exporting producer and most likely also the other two Chinese exporting producers have considerable spare capacity in view of the significant decrease in their exports from 1999 to the IP.
Moreover, the unused production capacity of the sole co-operating exporting producer is able to meet roughly half of the Community consumption. (48) The apparent Community consumption in the IP was around 270 million pieces, of which only 5 million pieces were declared as originating in the PRC.
Therefore, and in view of the spare capacity of the Chinese exporting producers, it is likely that imports from the PRC to the Community market could resume in significant quantities if the anti-dumping measures were allowed to expire.
DEFINITION OF THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (50) During the IP RBM were manufactured in the Community by the following producers: - Krause Ringbuchtechnik GmbH, Espelkamp, Germany - SX Bürowaren Produktions- und Handels GmbH (until November 2001 RBM had been manufactured by Koloman Handler AG), Vienna, Austria - Industria Meccanica Lombarda srl, Offanengo, Italy. (51) The first two producers are the applicants and co-operated in the investigation.
Other information available was also used to calculate the sales of the Community producer not included in the definition of the Community industry. (53) For imports originating in the PRC and imports declared as originating in Thailand, Eurostat figures were used with the exception of the figures regarding imports declared as originating in the PRC in the IP, for which the information provided by the co-operating Chinese exporting producer was used. (54) As to the imports originating in other third countries, the figures on imports originating in India and Indonesia, with the exception of those related to the IP, have been obtained from the anti-dumping proceeding concerning these two countries.
It should also be noted that Eurostat figures had to be converted from tonnes into pieces. (55) On this basis, the apparent Community consumption decreased by 9% during the period considered, from 297 million pieces (figures rounded to the million) in 1998 to 270 million pieces in the IP.
Imports from the country concerned (a) Import volume and market share (56) The imports declared as originating in the PRC decreased sharply, from 44 million pieces in 1998 to 24 million pieces in 1999, to 10 million pieces in 2000 and to 5 million pieces in the IP.
The market share of the imports declared as originating in the PRC fell in each year of the period considered, from 14.8% in 1998 to 7.8% in 1999, to 3% in 2000 and to 1.9% in the IP. (b) Price evolution of the imports of the product concerned (57) The average price of the imports declared as originating in the PRC increased by 96% between 1998 (EUR 141) and the IP (EUR 278).
The upward trend of the prices of imports declared as originating in the PRC reflects the growing weight of more expensive product types subject to an MIP (RBM with 17 and 23 rings) rather than a genuine price increase. 3.
The market share of the imports declared as originating in Thailand increased in each year of the period considered, from 0.3% in 1998 to 5.2% in 1999, to 5.3% in 2000 and to 7.4% in the IP.
The average price of the imports declared as originating in Thailand fell by 9% in the same period, from EUR 100 to EUR 91.
Economic situation of the Community industry[9] (a) Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (59) The production of the Community industry decreased by 17% over the period considered from 100 (index number) in 1998 to 91 in 1999, to 89 in 2000 and to 83 in the IP.
Koloman Handler AG's decision to transfer part of its production to Hungary in 2000 accounts for the decrease of production in that year.
In the IP, Koloman Handler AG filed for bankruptcy and its production decreased significantly in the second half of 2001. (60) The production capacity of the Community industry decreased by 7% in the period considered.
It increased in 1999 to 107 (index number) and then fell to 93 in 2000 as a result of Koloman Handler AG's decision to transfer part of its production to Hungary.
Production capacity stabilised in the IP. (61) Capacity utilisation fell from above 80% in 1998 to 70-75% in 1999, then increased to 76-80% in 2000 and decreased again to 70-75% in the IP. (b) Stocks (62) The Community industry's closing stocks fell by 37% in the period considered, having fallen in each year of that period.
The main factor contributing to this decrease was the slowdown of Koloman Handler AG's production after filing for bankruptcy.
The period during which stocks were kept before being sold was reduced by 10 days in the period considered. (c) Sales volume, market share and growth (63) The Community industry's sales on the Community market decreased by 8% over the period considered, from 119 million pieces in 1998 to 109 million pieces in the IP.
Profitability improved from 0-3% in 1998 to 3.1%-6% in 1999 and then fell abruptly to between 0% and -3% in 2000 and it was lower than -3% in the IP.
This negative performance certainly contributed to the fact that the two companies concerned went into bankruptcy: Koloman Handler AG in July 2001 and Krause Ringbuchtechnik GmbH in April 2002 (i.e.
It fell to 52 (index number) in 1999, to 48 in 2000 and to 35 in the IP. (70) The ability of the Community industry to raise capital was dented by its consistently poor profitability. (g) Return on investment (71) As equity became negative in 2000 and both Community producers subsequently filed for bankruptcy, the return on total assets (%quot%ROTA%quot%) was used to measure the return on investment.
Cash flow increased from 100 (index number) in 1998 to 126 in 1999, and then decreased sharply to 62 in 2000 and to -65 in the IP. (i) Employment, productivity and wages (73) Employment (full-time units) fell in each year of the period considered, from 100 (index number) in 1998 to 86 in 1999, to 82 in 2000 and to 77 in the IP. (74) Productivity, measured in thousand pieces per employee, improved by 8% over the period considered, while labour costs per unit of output, measured in EUR per kg, decreased by 12% in the same period. (j) Magnitude of the actual margin of dumping (75) There is no finding of actual dumping during the IP for imports declared as originating in the PRC as the findings for these imports relate to a small and not representative range of RBM.
In 2001, the IP of the current investigation, they sold 5 million pieces declared as originating in the PRC.
The facts that there is significant spare capacity in the PRC (while Chinese exports to third countries are decreasing in volume) and that the behaviour of Chinese exporting producers has consistently shown that they are willing to sell at dumped and injurious prices to gain market share, clearly indicate that there is a likelihood of recurrence of injurious dumping through imports originating in the PRC if the anti-dumping measures expired. (79) The Community is the only market where Chinese exporting producers could still increase market share, as the other markets are already supplied by Chinese producers or producers in third countries controlled by Chinese producers.
If WWS was able to absorb a significant part of its 32.5% anti-dumping duty and the other Chinese companies did the same of their 39.4% duty, then it is most likely that in the absence of anti-dumping measures they would be in a position to increase their strong downward pressure on the prices of RBM sold in the Community. (80) It is recalled that the average price of RBM declared as originating in Thailand fell by 9% over the period considered and a comparison between average selling price of a European distributor of RBM declared as originating in Thailand and the Community industry's weighted average selling price showed that the former was around 12% lower than the latter. (81) As to imports from other third countries, Hungary is part of the Community since 1 May 2004 onwards.
As concerns India and Indonesia, exporting producers in both of these countries are controlled by Chinese exporting producers.
If the measures on imports originating in the PRC expire, the incentive to export RBM from India and Indonesia to the Community would be reduced, as it is likely that in this case there would be a sharp increase in dumped imports coming directly from the PRC. (82) Given the already precarious situation of the Community industry, the aforementioned substantial increase of imports from the PRC at dumped prices combined with substantial price undercutting would undoubtedly have serious consequences for the Community industry.
They are facing a difficult environment in which low-priced, often dumped and subsidised injurious imports from third countries remain a threat.
The expiry of the anti-dumping measures on imports originating in the PRC could seriously undermine that strategy, as Chinese exporting producers have shown in the past that they would push prices down to dumped levels in order to gain market share.
Bearing in mind that the effects of the measures in place have been partially undermined by absorption practices and by dumped or subsidised RBM imports from Indonesia, the possible expiry of such measures would most likely make the current restructuring efforts of the Community industry impossible. (92) The Community industry has a long tradition, but it is very likely that it would cease to exist if the current restructuring efforts fail.
KG filed for bankruptcy in January 1998.
Its successor, Krause Ringbuchtechnik GmbH, owned by Wilhelm vom Hoffe Drahtwerke GmbH since June 1998, filed for bankruptcy in April 2002.
SX Bürowaren Produktions- und Handels GmbH continues the tradition of Koloman Handler AG.
The Community industry is viable, as even after several bankruptcies it is still in a position to supply an important part of the Community market, in particular, in conjunction with the production site located in Hungary, which became part of the Community production on 1 May 2004. (94) SX Bürowaren Produktions- und Handels GmbH's acquisition of Bensons, a long time trader of RBM with companies located in the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the USA, clearly shows the will of the Community industry to enhance its access to the market on a world-wide basis and the seriousness of its restructuring efforts. (95) There were two main issues raised after disclosure.
Interests of importers (98) The only two co-operating unrelated importers were acquired by SX Bürowaren Produktions- und Handels GmbH in August 2002, thus becoming related to the Community industry after the IP.
The reasons behind the decisions of these users were mainly motivated by lower labour costs and the proximity of those countries to the Community market, combined with the perspective that these countries will become members of the European Union on 1 May 2004.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms currently classifiable within CN code ex 8305 10 00 originating in the People's Republic of China.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, shall be as follows: (a) for mechanisms with 17 and 23 rings (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 21, 8305 10 00 22 and 8305 10 00 29), the amount of duty shall be equal to the difference between the minimum import price of EUR 325 per 1000 pieces and the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty; (b) for mechanisms other than those with 17 or 23 rings (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 11, 8305 10 00 12 and 8305 10 00 19) +++++ TABLE +++++ Unless otherwise specified, the provisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply.
Article 2 This anti-dumping duty shall be imposed for a period of four years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
