Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning statistics on plant protection products {SEC(2006) 1623} {SEC(2006) 1624} /* COM/2006/0778 final - COD 2006/0258 */ EN Brussels, 11.12.2006 COM(2006) 778 final 2006/0258 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning statistics on plant protection products (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1623} {SEC(2006) 1624} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 1.1.
Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs [4], in particular Annex I, part A, point 9 establishing an obligation for food business operators producing or harvesting plant products to keep records on any use of plant protection products or biocides.
A wide Internet-based consultation was then organised from December 2004 until January 2005 on the report concerning the impact assessment of the different measures proposed.
The specific measures concerning pesticide statistics were discussed with the Member States in the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) and its 'Pesticides Statistics Expert Group' from September 2004 until May 2006. 2.1.2.
The overall net financial impact of mandatory data collection with a high level of accuracy at Community level is estimated at 15 million €/year per year.
This measure is likely to impact most significantly on authorities (9 million €/year additional burden), while the additional cost to industry of collecting more detailed data on sales could reach 2 million €/year.
The economic impact on users (mainly farmers) is estimated at 4 million €/year, as mandatory collection of data on use would require a significant contribution on their part.
Legal basis Article 285 provides the legal basis for Community statistics.
Therefore the Community may adopt these measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiary as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. 3.4.
This Regulation establishes a framework for the production of Community statistics on the placing on the market and use of plant protection products. 2.
Article 3 Data collection, transmission and processing 1.
Data shall be presented according to the classification given in Annex III. 3.
Member States shall transmit the data in electronic form, in conformity with an appropriate technical format to be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(2). 4.
Member States shall produce reports on the quality of the statistics as stated in Annexes I and II. 5.
The Commission shall determine the quality evaluation criteria in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(3). 6.
Article 4 Implementation measures 1.
The following measures necessary for implementation of this Regulation, including measures to take account of economic and technical developments, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 5(2): (a) adoption of the appropriate technical format for the transmission of data (Article 3(3)); (b) definition of the format and content of the quality reports to be supplied by the Member States (Section 6 of Annexes I and II); 2.
The following measures shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 5(3): (a) determination of quality evaluation criteria (Article 3 (5)); (b) definition of the 'area of crop treated' and of the ‘crop season’ referred to in Sections 2 and 4 of Annex II respectively; (c) adaptation of the specifications listed in Section 3 of Annexes I and II, regarding the reporting measures; (d) adaptation of the list of substances to be covered and their classification in categories of products and chemical classes as given in Annex III.
Article 5 Committee procedure 1.
The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be three months. 3.
Article 6 Report The Commission shall submit a report on the implementation of the Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council every five years.
This report shall evaluate in particular the quality of data transmitted, the burden on businesses and the usefulness of these statistics in the context of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
Article 7 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Done at Brussels, […] For the European Parliament For the Council The President The President […] […] ANNEX I Statistics on placing of plant protection products on the market SECTION 1 Coverage The statistics shall cover all substances listed in Annex III consisting of active substances, safeners or synergists contained in plant protection products placed on the market in each Member State.
SECTION 2 Variables The quantity of each substance listed in Annex III contained in plant protection products placed on the market shall be compiled.
SECTION 3 Reporting measure Data shall be expressed in kilograms of substances.
SECTION 4 Reference period The reference period shall be the calendar year.
SECTION 5 First reference period, periodicity and transmission of results 1.

The report concerning the second reference year shall contain a raw estimate of the proportions of the total quantity of substances in each major group listed in Annex III contained in plant protection products placed on the market for both agricultural and non-agricultural use.
Each Member State shall select a set of crops listed in categories D, F, G and I of the characteristics defined in Annex I of Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 and shall compile statistics for these crops.
The quantity of each substance listed in Annex III contained in plant protection products used on each selected crop shall be compiled with the total area cultivated and the 'area of the crop treated' with each substance. 2.
SECTION 3 Reporting measures 1.
SECTION 4 Reference period 1.
SECTION 5 First reference period, periodicity and transmission of results 1.
The first five-year period shall start at the first calendar year following the entry into force of the Regulation. 4.
