In this paper we propose to mine more precise patterns of the form “young users buy products A and B then product C, while old users do not follow this same behavior”.
By highlighting relevant properties of such contexts, we show how contextual sequential patterns can be extracted by mining the database in a concise manner.
We conduct our experimental evaluation on real-world data and demonstrate performance issues.
