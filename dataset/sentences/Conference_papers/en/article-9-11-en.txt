The system {¢,l,^} is used by Nasr (1995), while the system noted {•,l,–,+,^}, is considered by Bonfante et al. (2004), who show advantages of negative and positive polarities for prefiltration in parsing (a set of structures bearing negative and positive polarities can only be reduced into a neutral structure if the sum of negative polarities of each object type is equal the sum of positive polarities).
