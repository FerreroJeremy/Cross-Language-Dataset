Let us recall that a derivation tree for a contextfree grammar is an ordered tree.
An ordered tree combines two structures on the same set of nodes: a structure of tree and a precedence relation on the node of the tree.
Here the precedence relation is explicitly represented (a “node” of the tree precedes another “node” if the target of the first one is the source of the second one).
When they calculate the precedence relation, parsers (of the CKY type for instance) in fact calculate a data structure like the one we present here, where beginnings and ends of phrase are explicitly considered as objects.
