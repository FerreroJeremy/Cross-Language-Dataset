Discourse segmentation aims at splitting texts into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are non-overlapping units that serve to build a discourse structure of a document.
Current state of the art approaches in discourse segmentation make an extensive use of syntactic information.
Unfortunately, some languages do not have any robust parser.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of Arabic discourse segmentation using a supervised learning approach that predicts nested EDUs.
The performance of our segmenter was assessed on two genres of corpora: elementary school textbooks that we build ourselves and documents extracted from the Arabic Treebank.
We show that a combination of typographical, morphological and lexical features is sufficient to achieve good results in segment boundaries detection.
In addition, we show that adding low-level syntactic features that are manually encoded in ATB does not enhance the performance of our segmenter.
