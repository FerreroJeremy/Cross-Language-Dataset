Some JDM Network Characteristics At the moment of the writing of this article, JDM network contains 251358 terms and over 1500000 relations (amongst them 14658 being negative).
More than 4500 terms have some refinements (various usages) for a total of around 15000 usages.
Although JDM has ontological relations, it is not an ontology per se with some clean and wellthough hierarchy of concepts or terms.
A given term can have a substantial set of hypernyms that covers a large part of the ontological chain to upper concepts.
In the previous hyperonyms set, we omitted weights for simplification, but in all generality, heavier terms are those felt by users as being themost relevant.
