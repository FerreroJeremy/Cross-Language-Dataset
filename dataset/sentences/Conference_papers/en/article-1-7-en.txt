The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 briefly recalls some needed definitions and the main concepts of the MODL approach.
Then, we describe our extension of the MODL approach for classification rules and a Bayesian criterion for evaluating the robustness of rules.
Section 3 reports the experiments we led to validate the proposed criterion.
We, then discuss further related work in section 4.
Finally, section 5 briefly concludes and opens several perspectives for future work.
