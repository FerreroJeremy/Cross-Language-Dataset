I is the specificity of a relation (w; rel;w0), defined as the mutual information between the triplet elements [5].
Let's note kwk the total information quantity associated to w.
Finally, similarity between two lemmas w1 and w2 measures the extent to which they share specific syntactic contexts, using the information quantity of their shared contexts, normalised by the sum of their total informa- tion quantities.
