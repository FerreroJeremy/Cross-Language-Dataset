In the meantime, no credit should be given to the amounts registered in revenues, as they are not them but the price rate to conventional that appropriate employees of different goods in payment of their salaries, and no so the real value they produce when they are allocated to other buyers.
After Every employee has taken some of the effects on recovery of his salary, the excess is Espido to Santa-Cruz, where it is sold for the government, who by way of relief instead gives each year, four loaves of salt, spawned two hundred wool, two thousand pounds iron, steel three hundred, four knives, a few reams of paper, a bag seventy pounds of flour and wine for the offices of the churches.
Well how inadequate it is estimated portions should be such a population of twenty-three thousand souls.
A more productive plant for the state, residents Moxos grown for consumption of the province, all those that are typical of warmer regions, such as rice, maize, groundnuts, beans, the sapallos, cassava, sweet potatoes, papayas, pineapples, orange and bananas.
Moxos province, on account of the elevation of temperature, offers all the productions natural hot countries of central America.
Its forests are inhabited by various monkey species whose skins are truly magnificent, deer numbers are provided hunting to much advantage; of large animals, abundant mainly east of the province and whose leather, very convenient for its length and flexibility to harness the cars, would be of great importance in trade.
The pericoligeros are also remarkable for their skin, the very great profits that can be drawn.
Hunting in general can not be more abundant.
The forests contain thousands of birds, the same as the plains, where to hunt them are crossed on foot or by canoe, according to the stations.
Since so many rivers and lakes, fish so plentiful, that alone would suffice to satisfy a large part of the needs of people in Moxos, if they knew these any process for regular fishing.
The rivers are full of shells containing a pearl so shiny and bright as that of the mother-Ocean Pearl Islands and Panama.
The carpentry and joinery timbers are many and varied, and the palm trees adorn the banks of all rivers, and between the totai distinguished, the main action of indigenous peoples in times of distress.
The palm leaves, palm fronds, sumuque, totai and cucis, used to roof the houses of the Indians or to tect hats and other items.
The trunk of carondai used in the construction of solid roof, giving to it the cutting and convenient way.
The palm called chonta, is very useful for the hardness of your Meder Black and beautiful: many palms, including those identified by the marayahu give juicy fruit and pleasant, as are also the palm fronds and cucis his excellency totai coconut oils.
The heart of all these trees can also provide a healthy and happy.
There are plenty of trees and plants that exude resins and various oils, applicable to Industry: Indians to dye objects yellow, red and black, they use some simple that they are particularly popular.
Copaiba is very common, and the salsáfras, the guayacan or palo santo, etc.
As the current trade in the province, as I said, almost esclusivamante an attribution State-profit, no sooner was determined to go down once a year to its market, some speculators Short capital, either by way of Cochabamba, either by the Santa-Cruz, but more often this last point, which is the most advantageous to the merchants for the best reception are given.
Traders who wish to enter the province with the purpose of sale, send request canoes send them immediately to Four-Eyes, Port Santa-Cruz, or to Yuracares, port of Cochahamba.
The charges to these traders are from two to ten percent: must also pay for their accommodation and round-table handling, a real diary, when they use canoes to go to other places, the pay assigned to each rower is three real.
All this is paid at the current price goods admitted in the square, which is three times higher than the real and rational, a loaf of salt, for example, is two dollars, a blanket, four, etc., etc.
The effects are more marketable, iron, steel, wool spawns; tools agriculture such as axes, machetes, shovels, etc., and salt; the genres of cotton, the thread wool of various colors, the beads or beads, mainly yellow, the beads; silver medals or the silver coin that the Indians hung around his neck instead of medals; knives out of wood, the ordinary Tigeras, cotton handkerchiefs of colors living, etc.., etc.
According to the current system, employees are determined to reverse the entry of merchandise Cochabamba, in order to book a Santa-Cruz only trade with Moxos; limited east to the present, to the simple exchange of securities cases, it has not yet entered to move money around in the streets of the province.
When traders want to collect some fruits, are routed directly to the capital at the time going down to her usual administrators, leading the annual products of their respective missions.
All these employees then sell the goods they received in payment of their wages while The Indians also make some negotiations, giving their cacao crops instead of several items whose positive value is totally unknown to them: in such acts used all his guile to deceive the traders to the Indians, who in turn take thousand precautions to avoid being deceived indeed very unequal contest.
To measure portions indigenous cocoa sírvense a small pumpkin, called herepo; equivalent measure little more or less to two pounds of seed: Prior to the exchange, each effect stranger is estimated at many herepos.
With this traffic, the number of tons of cocoa Esporta every year, when less than five thousand.
The other products that use be waived today, consist of, in cow leather or animal jungle, article of little value to the present, in wax, indigo, vanilla, sugar, coffee in timber joinery; in dye stick, coconut oils and copal; in different resins, copal, incense, etc.., etc.
Currently only Moxos traded in the department of Cochabamba, and more particularly with the Santa-Cruz, whose governors have banned almost always communication and relationships trade with the province of Chiquitos.
Trade with Santa-Cruz de la Sierra, which in truth is the only regular active, practice up and down the river to the port Piray of Four Eyes, and by the Rio Grande Payload up or Bibosi, which lies about a hundred and fifty leagues from the mission of Loreto.
The first of these rivers has some rapids, difficult to dry to save time, but they disappear In the rainy season: the much longer distance seconded by his many rodeos.
Trade with the department of Cochabamba is almost nil, and never has been thought to This how easy it would bring some Brazilian trade with the fort of Beira, or with Para down the Madeira River.
However, under current circumstances many jumps and falls of this river have great difficulties for their free navigation, which review will give here a slight to they can be seen somewhat similar problems.
More below the confluence Mamore and Guaporé is possible to navigate the space of a few days without finding the slightest pregnancy, starting from the point already indicated in the road that takes to go from San-Joaquin Exaltation to the vehicle of these rivers.
Towards the tenth grade is the point of Itenes reunion of the Mamore [1] and not an island far away, kind of pretty rock large and spacious where you can build a fort.
From this point to the mouth Madeira River will have two hundred sixty leagues, in the sixty first encountered twelve waterfalls or rapids. 1 st The first waterfall, which bears the name of Madeira, is a little below the mentioned island, and consists of three hops or steps to embrace half a league long.
To save it is necessary to download the canoes, é irlas pulling ropes for the space of six hundred rods. 2 nd Half a league below are struggling with the Mercy.
The work cost the navigator the passage of this cascade, and the risks to which it exposes, dependent on river height. 3 rd Another half mile later, we present the cachuela of Ribeirao, consisting of five jumps occupying the space of a league and tertiary.
To pass, the travelers unload their canoes, transporting goods on the shoulders by a shot of three thousand yards, while towing lightened the vessel, or the drag on the ground. 4 th four leagues below the waterfall of Figueira, composed of islets and rocks that can not be saved but impelled by a great work and great skill. 5 th Pederneiras then presented the twelve leagues below, the point where the river is full of rocks that occur along the water, putting the rider in need to unload the vessel to tow while carrying goods by land, on a piece of four hundred eighty yards. 6 ª Three leagues farther encountered with Paredao cachuela of where the river narrows and quickly runs through rocks, but for a short distance. 7 th Six miles later, he found the Three Brothers, formed by some breaks minor embracing a quarter of a league, without being big hindrance to navigation. 8 th eight leagues below presents the cachuela Giran, where the river being very narrow and being sandwiched between two hills, runs so fast that it is necessary to download the canoes ashore and drag them out for a distance of hundred yards.
On the east bank, opposite of this superb dam is a set of rocks, which Western auction being closed, does that meet in a narrow waters of the three channels, the extremity of rocks and the left bank of river.
There is therefore indispensable to pull the boats ashore and drag with a lot of work for a stretch of five hundred yards. 12 th A little over a mile away cachuela hampered by the San-Antonio, where they spend the waters divided into three channels formed by two rocky islets.
You must download the canoes in order to save this step.
This cachuela, first presented to the travelers who sail upstream, is placed under the 8 degrees 48 minutes south latitude.
Empléanse usually three months to climb from the waterfall to the Guaporé.
From San-Antonio cachuela to the mouth of the Madeira River are counted more than thirty islands are generally three miles long, and are populated by the most beautiful trees : There are also countless smaller islands, the largest among these, is called Mine, which stretches about two miles and a half to the length and width of which is a little more or less than a league: This island is located seventeen miles below the mouth River of Marmellos.
The waters of the Madeira River and the Rio Marañon river are black, which has a league width at points where there are no islands, it embraces two and sometimes more in those where there.
Sixty miles below the Madeira River, going straight, or ninety, following the windings, is to meet at the famous river Marañon Tapajoz, and sixty leagues under the latter, the Xingu river, also very plentiful, and lower Cuyaba province.
Moral and administrative improvements that the province is susceptible.
Being now the province of Moxos head of a department is likely to prosper without interruption in all respects and in all areas, particularly if the care provided prefectural government to instruct his men to make educated and able to march in front introducing into it since then, and at the same time, any possible improvements.
It is above all necessary to reform the religious abuses I have mentioned, but it is necessary work in this regard with the utmost tact, and taking the utmost care so as not to go to the Indians from one end to another, of their fanatical beliefs to a full irreligion.
All the reforms of this kind should not be introduced but little by little, without making use of absolute rules, and making the transition is insensitive to the utmost.
The medium would be more effective to put in these educated church missions, that would make excel healthy and well-understood moral of Catholicism in the religious beliefs of the Moxenos, on abolishing exaggerated penances and punishments bloody, unworthy and agencies and the enlightened age in which we live.
Meanwhile, there would no longer be harmful to my way to see that the civilian administration ostensibly meddle in the execution of these reforms, serious as feared that reaching the Moxos to be freed from this background that keeps religion offline, it corrupted everything.
Finally, the execution of such a reform is extremely difficult, and requires all the wisdom, the wisdom of an enlightened government, to be driving the car of the improvements with the greatest possible restraint and caution.
A people who lived during almost two centuries, accustomed to more humble servility, and to not have anything in property can not move from a blow to full independence without exposing to greater evils than which seeks to redress.
It would then need to place at the same time, in every mission, a man able to teach with due care to these infants of civilization to take the first steps towards freedom of action, towards individual ownership, and above all, towards relations This mutation determines social things.
Meanwhile, it is clear that if trade All their activity is not power the Moxenos, to encourage further work to industry, making them meet certain needs while still ignored being too sober in nature, and little ambitious, certainly abandon all gainful occupation as soon as they saw free, and will result from this fact, instead of civilization perhaps his greatest hindrance.
There is also a factor to consider important, and that the inhabitants of Moxos are nothing more than mere craftsmen, and that this class of individuals, even in Europe itself, can not make any progress, but under the direction of learned men and able to engage in any kind of improvement.
It is necessary see that a people and a high degree of civilization to sugetarse factory work; Moxeño so that, seeing books before they be established manufactures in the province to take up arms, came out, I repeat, by losing what little they know today, at the same while industrial habits.
This is one of the highest political economy issues that the government will know probably appreciate it properly, taking measures that will lead the general interest of the inhabitants, while tending to the advancement of the country.
Always returning to the same subject, and I insist that frequent certain relationships by trade, and continued contact of natural men who are Moxos exceed the education, customs and industry, can only operate between them by little and little natural and positive reform, in that, any action out of time maybe it would bring disastrous results.
Therefore urges primarily promote trade by abolishing certain taxation to facilitate it, and then the Moxos, knowing what they are worth, and they can do to procure the welfare, civilized and march towards a social state prosperous and stable.
To aid in this forward march, is indispensable, as it has practiced the current government, schools that teach not only the Spanish language, but also mathematics and drawing, in order to do that they go together, moral instruction, industrial and commercial.
To encourage the study would be necessary, there more than anywhere Moreover, distributed as a reward honorable awards provided the talent and to the nature of individuals, since it had some that were marked by any kind merit.
We must not lose sight of the creatures Moxeño are great, and that will result from them whatever you want, provided that the good deeds will be timely rewarded somehow.
One of the essential measures for improving this province, it is particularly which is aimed at preventing the death of the creatures, and the plague of smallpox that strike adults.
It is therefore of absolute need to seat in each canton to a doctor paid by the government and responsible for manage relevant health condoms.
The priests, whom the ministry gets more in touch with the people, should take his by propagating the vaccine, and epidemics, constantly monitor the actions of Indians to prevent these from leaving their homes to go to bathe, as they always do, shopping with passengers life a relief.
It could also pray for the priests, care to take great care to preserve the creature born of the action recently South Wind, as pernicious in this province and that of Caupolican.
