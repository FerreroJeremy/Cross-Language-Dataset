They sensed the coming of the enemy, and seeing without strength or weapons for them to stand in a meeting and open resistance campaign, determined repaired with industry, because they could not defend themselves with weapons.
In order to this they did to hide some narrow road next to a jungle where they had to pass the enemies, and hidden here and waited until they came to this narrow way, against those who were discovered after the trees, played his poisoned arrows except with poison so active, being wounded to fall dead was very little happening.
Those who remained alive explored everywhere where it came from that storm, and then some time fell into the trick, but then failing to avenge that otherwise injury or death of peers, which saved her breasts revenge for another time, against his will, had to go back.
Therefore, at the beginning of the following year they embarked on a body of the Paraguay River and entered into the lagoon Mamoré provided and landed at the port of Itatines.
Hence continued their defeat by East-Midi, and sometimes through very thick forests, other very rugged mountains rising (how can greed), leading to the settlements of the Taus, and made them fair game, went to execute his revenge in Penoquíes that lost very confident, because although Rancheria Rancheria in word spread up the people of San Francisco Xavier of the enemy came, they did not step in preventing some defense, or at least to retire and take refuge in that reduction, and because they can would not then when they wanted, they could not escape their lives, because those wicked walking with industry to get rid of their poisoned arrows, fell upon them unexpectedly.
Notwithstanding this, the mood had Penoquíes to expose to the defense as best they could and resist the first encounter, but the enemies, cunning and shrewd, somewhat detained pretending were preparing to fight, but it was just to make time for the fellow hiciesen rearguard landowners on the other side and cogiesen the mob of women and children.
They warned the Indians that when the enemy had made their attempt, they found themselves deceived with the loss of clothing so loved, for whose defense had taken up arms, were discouraged completely, which turns the back as best they could, they retreated to the forests without resistance of the victors, who felt that the love of their blood the slaves would volunteer as in fact happened, for which reason the victors did not put them in prison but treated them with kindness and courtesy, and views of the chiefs of colorful costumes and ornaments, promising thousand joys and happiness in San Pablo and thereby deceive and take them for guidance to other lands and to arrive at the San Francisco Xavier reduction, already had moved, transporting it to the other side of the San Miguel River.
Came the news of this misfortune to the people of that was inexplicable Chiriguaná the grief that had the P.
Arce, seeing that the enemy like a whirlwind out of the abyss, that razed his Paradise, which had cost both the plant and the point was desalted to repair and defend the lives of their neophytes.
To this end, not without great risk of his, wanted to register the country to observe more closely steps of the enemy, and through the villages of Boxos, partitions and Taus, was received of them with pleasure.
Here those who had escaped him news of the designs of the Mamalucos, and taking during the storm which threatened them, persuaded them came together in a body and sleeves a reduction in advantageous place to fend off the incursions of those infernal beasts and what before had been unable to collect petitions, putting them on the grounds their eternal salvation; got it now the desire to save their lives.
Themselves together, then, all bathed in a river plain Jacopo, which was given shortly before Reduction principle to San Rafael, well suited to defend themselves because of a very thick jungle, where they had placed all their hopes, and removed his few Alhajuela there, no dared to shake from that position until this storm calmed down with the Apostolic Father, who stood there for a few days in order to penetrate the designs of the enemy, had occasion comfortable to baptize the children and instruction in the mysteries of our holy faith to the large fear to whom slavery was a wake Mamalucos to go out and of the devil, but the Father, warned that time would not baptize them, reserving for a better opportunity to satisfy their desires, and encourage them to perseverance, turned the Reduction San Francisco Xavier, and from here, with all haste, came to Santa Cruz Sierra, to report to the Governor of the enemy's movements, and join encourage weapons to people to take the field to fight with him and put to flight, which was not very to do to move as innate piety of the Spanish who shines everywhere also that the value by making them to take their trespasses Chiquitos Indians and defend himself with his own blood that new church, namely that one could rightly fear that the pride of Mamalucos also dared to invade the city if they did not saliesen the meeting to cut switchbacks or the steps.
Alistáronse therefore few hours in hundred and thirty soldiers, well armed with weapons and ammunition and the main thing of value, and because time was not much room, they marched to long hours to the town of San Francisco Xavier, which collected about three hundred highly skilled Indians playing the bow and arrow, went looking for the enemy to the lands of believing Penoquís would find there the quartered, when by means of spies knew they had entered in the town of San Francisco Xavier, which they had abandoned and left shortly before, wherein like Mamalucos have not found anything to steal were preparing to go to surprise the city of Santa Cruz.
With this new joy was inexplicable that showed the value waiting in Spanish able to give their due to those infamous, which was to be feared or predicted heart Captain ominous enemies, as seen in San Francisco Xavier many footprints horses, suspected that the Spanish were ready and wanted to turn back, which would implemented to some Indians had not told the country that had recently been there the cattle Reduction San Francisco Xavier.
Straightened, then, the march our army to where the enemies were encamped, and into the night arrived near where they were and determined to await the morning of Next, it was the glory of the Spanish martyr San Lorenzo, principal lawyer and pattern that province, to present the battle.
With that the soldiers had some time to rest, and as he did not believe that the battle had to be very bloody for both sides to have to fight with people so skilled in use weapons, they wanted the most fine-God part of your consciousness, for I heard the confession which six parents who had come from this end there.
In this he spent much of the night, and having taken a bit of sleep, at dawn to dawn touched up, sending officers arrayed soldiers, and the gun point, move the sight of the enemy and if not surrender weapons, attacked.
But God had taken his account of the punishment of the wickedness of those wicked, now did they paid the penalty, and particularly the captains, who were here dead together once paying all debts of the evils they had committed in the destruction of the peoples of the Holy Spirit Villarica in the government of Paraguay, providing the victory was not at the expense of much blood on both sides as previously thought but at the expense of ours and a lot of enemies because while an Indian intimated the order to the enemy, anticipating certain soldiers to receive the arms of the captains, a servant of these firing a fusilazo stopped them, killing one of them.
He could not suffer this Andrew Florian valiant Spanish gentleman, and then responded with another similar shot, that shot down in the ground at Ferraez Antonio de Araujo, and drawing his knife attacked to Manuel Frias and he stabbed her to death, being the first step the two captains dead enemies.
With this being the Mamalucos without leaders, without government and without the strength, they were troubled the everything, and threw his arms into the river that they received, not for free as expected, but to bury them in their current, already tired, how much effort they made, could not escape.
Displaying the Spanish and obviously our neophytes that God was on their side, were with great spirit in scope, and a storm of arrows and musket shot them, made them bloody havoc.
Missionaries also our wish to enter to the party in fact so great, assisting with the crucifix in hand, and regardless of life went ahead with their spiritual weapons, not only in support of the victors, but also the defeated, whom they sought help.
The enemy only six escaped with their lives, including three badly wounded, were prisoners.
Our casualties were few, and only eight dead, two Indians and six Spanish.
But it was not complied with the happy, because while trying to exterminate the rest of enemies who had remained in the land of the Penoquís in the dam guard who rode more than fifteen hundred souls, and completely clean the country, were born, I do not know from what source, some disagreements between the ropes, with which it had the best advice and break camp back to the city of San Lorenzo, where saliéronlos to receive the governor, mayors and with the city council, were greeted with festive ringing of the bells of all Many churches and artillery that fired the castle, and for many days celebrated with great magnificence that nothing short of miraculous victory.
Mamalucos The three who escaped, walked with the speed as possible following his escape and took so sad news to his companions, who, knowing his hope against all the ultimate destruction of their own, were stiff with fear, and as if they saw near him to the victors, they left in a hurry, taking the more slaves they could, and shipped in the Paraguay River and Rowing vogue sailed to San Pablo Road, when encountering a company of his own countrymen who went to the same purpose of capturing pieces (as called here) or Indians, told them the incident referred to, but those who came from St.
As they crossed the pond Mamore Guarayos some great time that had militated his salary, his eyes open and turning it upon themselves to ponder the little good and much bad that they did, and that finally he could not expect more than a hazardous profession death miserable by the end of an unhappy life, decided to drop out and find somewhere to live safely and rest, and using the darkness of night retreated westward to a campaign, two days ahead of the lake, and no women were found Curacanes friendships with, their neighbors on the side of the North.
These, then, not long after, wanting to get out of paganism and become Christians, they came to live and make our home in San Juan Bautista Reduction.
Was a rewarding victory, because since then I have not risked more Mamalucos to set foot on the contours of those reductions, and only planted in 1718 a fort on the banks of the Paragua River, eighty miles distant from the town of San Rafael, that is expected to soon turned to God for fifty or sixty thousand souls, as promised we hope, will prevent them from also doing corso by that river, because neophytes by a singular privilege of our Catholic kings, may use firearms that can easily break the pride of these pirates, as in the missions of Guarani, who never ceased to bother until those people gave a great Mamalucos rotates to five thousand who had gone to the final extermination of that Christianity.
Although the fortunes of this storm did not undo this new Christianity, however, moved slightly and cut not the best time during prosperous new increases, because August, hopes to increase flowering with a good number of souls Reduction San Francisco Xavier, and even found some in the Penoquís, Quicmes Xamar and who were willing to enlist in the number of the faithful, but rather of the accident came the destruction of Chiriguaná the two reductions, even as distant and remote from danger.
No one spoke to the learned gentleman air Agustin de Arce, when he said was lost in vain time and work with these people, and now I played with the hands of the missionaries, to which those barbarians loved only for what they pulled from their poverty.
Much as the Padres did not want to go to the Divine Office or hear the Christian doctrine that upon entering the night was explained, even wanted to give a boy to assist them in the estates of the house and serve the church and cultivate a small little garden.
With all that the missionaries persevered suffering great inconvenience and will work easier to tolerate was hoping to catch some fruit of patience, until angry the barbarians of so many sermons and speeches that made them throw them in the country were determined pretext that they were sent by Mamalucos to collect them and deliver them all in their hands as they had (as they said) made with the Chiquitos, though there were between many that this lie was seen by witnesses to have been serving the Spanish referred to the war.
Divulgóse this voice for the people, and was by them or by malice of evil ploy of the devil losing much in the conversion of the barbarians, the mob began to make many abuses the venerable P.
Knight and P.
Lucas Felipe Suarez, rather than with detestable audacity verifications fire to the church, where by this insult, they were obliged to go out and spend to a farm or cottage not far, but even this could stop because the barbarians searched everywhere armed with bows and clubs, and if not shattered hubiéranlos had been waiting for their bosses because they were not very far away.
Viewing our things were in such a bad face, resolved in the dark of the night retreat to Santa Cruz de la Sierra and hence pass to Pari, where he had Reduction moved San Francisco Xavier
