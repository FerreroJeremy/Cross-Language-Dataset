i loved the first two, but it's not just height. the story is very fragile, almost no action is all terribly boring. one aspect "key" schrek 1 and 2, ie the re-invention of some grotesque characters of fables for children, begins to fatigue becoming almost forced. even the characters in the heart of the story, especially donkey and puss in boots, seem to be there for decoration, without any real impact on history. as the english say, "you can not have too much of a good thing. " shrek 3 demonstrates the fairly obvious.
