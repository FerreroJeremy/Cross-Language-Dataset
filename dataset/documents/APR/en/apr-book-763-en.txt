this friendly grisham novel makes us follow in parallel, first, the race for the inheritance of 6 children spoiled rotten with money from their multibillion-father, and, secondly, the search for funds of 'amazon of the 7th heiress surprised by a lawyer in late career. we rub our hands in the opening lines, the early chapters are fascinating, then the story enters full swing (on the paraguay river!) and we take great pleasure in reading. the plot is punctuated with twists, the characters so well portrayed that they seem real and mechanisms of the u.s. law fully explained. the mixture of adventure stories and legal thriller is very well proportioned. i walked back to the end ... and i just go well for the pantanal if i was not afraid of alligators and anacondas!
