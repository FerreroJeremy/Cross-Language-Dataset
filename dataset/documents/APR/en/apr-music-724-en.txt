with sing the sorrow, it was understood that was over the top hardcore americans for afi. if the previous album was still excellent, decemberunderground has little flavor. the "concept" might seem interesting, however: a touch of electro / cold wave behind these punk-rock riffs but no, this album is totally missed it! after an intro almost hip / hop and "kill caustic" meant to remind us they have still yet between the legs, this new delivery admits be really bland. afi has transformed a group of power-pop-punk shopgirl and some songs like "the missing frame" or "the interview" is really unpleasant! failing abvoir lost their souls, afi wins in emo haircut this surely that will please many new fans, eager for excitement and "originality" ... appalling!
