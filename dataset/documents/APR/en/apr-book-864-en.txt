this is a new novel by valentine goby dark enough. here are three stories intersect and mingle. those of l. lucia, a young woman writhing in pain after an abortion, mary g., abortionist who is awaiting execution in his cell, henry d., executioner. the last day, last night passed and everyone lives in his own way this slow countdown before the inevitable. if the subject prior macabre can simmer (or simply reluctant) some readers, it would be a shame not to be tempted. in this story tight and dense, while a major event is about to approach and change their lives, the three characters leave their thoughts whirled, thinking of their childhood, the key events of their lives and that they pose are become today. for different reasons though related, each undergoes the overwhelming anxiety of the moment in a state of excitement that makes her more lucid thinking and allows him to perceive the feelings more acute. these broken destinies, these tormented lives are mixed and indirectly related with the urgency that characterizes the writing of valentine goby, which makes precision and violent upheavals intimately experienced by each protagonist. tribute to three characters that nothing should a priori be distinguished from others (as stated in the anonymity conferred by the first name followed by a trivial initial), this novel teeming with emotions not fail to shake his audience. this is a reading rich, sublime, although painful and a great novel, intensely lived, absolutely beautiful.
