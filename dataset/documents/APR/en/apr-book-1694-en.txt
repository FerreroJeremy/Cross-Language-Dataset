like all books with source for the secret services, it is full of unpublished information, very accurate, but impossible to verify. what is troublesome, however, are obvious mistakes, like that which is to say that prince turki al faisal is the son of king saud, while, as its name suggests, is that of king faisal. similarly, it is nonsense to say that turki belongs to the clan soudayri. a beautiful shot editing, but the rigor is not to go.
