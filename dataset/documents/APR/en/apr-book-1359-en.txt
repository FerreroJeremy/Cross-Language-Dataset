very big fan of robert ludlum, the watchmen of the apocalypse is, in my opinion one of his best books. indeed, ludlum revisits the theory of history "sonnenkinder" german children conceived for the most part during the second world war in order to release them into the world in positions of responsibilities, short of forming a network can take able at any moment. but the truth discovered by the hero is much more traumatic. even if the beginning of the book is a little winded, is the result of very large ludlum and the action was taken briskly until the final conclusion that leaves the reader speechless. a very very good book, ideal to start the series ludlum.
