only two souls meet in a tokyo crazy and between tradition and modernity ... bill murray and scarlett johansson leave explode their talent, their mines apathetic and roam the night clubs strip or sing karaoke songs by brian ferry or pretenders. eat sushi in making himself the head. they meet, meet, and vouvoient delight from beginning to end ... it's simply exhilarating! in this film scenario anemic, the key is sofia coppola sparkling and wonderfully made. i like (in bulk) bill murray as a cynical disillusioned, milky complexion of divine scarlett johansson, the musical band where it crosses phoenix, air and company. lost in translation is poetic, funny, touching and exotic tomorrow i buy the soundtrack and a ticket to japan!
