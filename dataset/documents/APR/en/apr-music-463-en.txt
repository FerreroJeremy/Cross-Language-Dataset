vanden plas is a jewel of german progressive metal or even global. kuntz had an album with abydos extroadinaire, then had it forced him and the whole group, expected to turn to christ o. well i found the results rather disappointing. indeed, the compounds are produced, the sound is good but it falls here in the parody style. nothing appears on this disc. no song or melody is retained because everything is "art". the group has certainly chosen here to celebrate the next "prog-art" forsaking melodies. this is an album that "listens to himself," i can say. fans will love, but others will find this album means.
