i read this book in 1997. i thought that the world imagined by tolkien was wonderful. not in the sense of narrative including witches, ogres and fairies, but because it has created a new world. seven years ago when i read it i thought it would make a very good film. and i am not mistaken. still, i was disappointed by the film. overall, he has remained faithful to tolkien. but it lacks the magic words that the pictures will never replace. i think that people who were not after reading them do not really experience the magic of a book. no book (and i'm a big eater) has aroused much passion in me. it is an incredible mural that could be real in the sense that the characters that cross react like you and me. the feelings, the reactions are real and human ... even among the elves. tolkien is a magician. i recommend reading this at all.
