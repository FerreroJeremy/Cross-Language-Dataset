louis de funès, 68, turned his latest film ... it's pretty sad indeed that he has finished on the film. fufu appears only as a shadow of himself, even worse than in the extra-terrestrial. the constable was not really to get into the 80s. it is also the last film of john girauly, director inseparable greatest popular success fufu ... very few good sequences to remember, but was seen again with obviously a lot of nostalgia.
