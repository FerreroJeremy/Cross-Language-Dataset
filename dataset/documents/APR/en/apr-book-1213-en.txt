the breviary of nothingness, this should be the subtitle of this book. if you believe in jesus, better not read it: it is an insult to philosophy if one does not, what interest? jesus, anyway, is not there. the work of m. lenoir aims to reverse the hierarchy: reduce the high to low. arguments unclear, imprecise approaches, new age rhetoric: nothing seduces us, or false thinking or journalistic style.
