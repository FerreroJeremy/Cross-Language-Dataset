after his second album went unnoticed (normal, camille made albums for her only) here is an album that makes you the effect of a session of torture and brainwashing. i think she should try her luck in the writing of contemporary music, and she would no longer appear listed in "the new french scene" but in a style more suitable to his "followers" and would be remembered forever.
