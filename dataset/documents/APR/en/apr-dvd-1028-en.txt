a mysterious yank (the quiet man) arrives on the train and asks for directions to innisfree. this quiet man turns out to be returning to his home after a hard life in america. there he purchases his train home to the shegrim neighbor of the "red" will danaher (victor mclagen); danaher covets the house himself. to ad insult to injury it looks like danaher's sister mary kate danaher (maureen o'hara) may be destined to marry our quiet man sean thornton (john wayne). we learn a few irish no-nos, such as you do not play patty fingers with the holy water. i will not go through the whole story as it is fun to watch it unfold. however there is a good example of horse sense as the horse knows to stop at the pub for michaeleen oge flynn (barry fitzgerald) whom has a very dry throat. the scenery along the bay and the fields gives the story a run for its money. be aware that different distributors have different quality of this product so the rating is for the movie not the packaging alone.
