louis leterrier (cocorico he is with us!) is a very good director of action films (strong version of clash of the titans) and proves it with this excellent hulk. this bluray offers a sublime image, sound, explosive sound system makes every strain and an armada of bonus (including 45 minutes of deleted scenes including an alternate intro very impressive). i have a samsung bdp p1500 (what a superb blu ray!) that reads the qb well without any problems. by cons, on the ps3 the subtitles (french and inserts vost) disappear after 10 minutes and the popup menu does not work during playback and it should reset everything if you want to access the bonus, great ! it is said "to have no further problems made downloading the latest update to the console and everything back to normal. well it's still not an exchange procedure with m6 but there is good still raging! my rating is because of this problem in part because it is a superb movie super heroes and taking effective contrast to the semi-soporific version of ang lee. you decide!
