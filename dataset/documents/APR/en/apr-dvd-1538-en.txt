father christmas tells a manner not suitable for toddlers stories with names and surnames from elsewhere that children are not halves, it is pleasing to see, or hear, i'm like my children five very disappointed with this dvd, i was called to be cartoons, not a man-father christmas filmed telling standing outside his hut. it's a shame, the idea was good!
