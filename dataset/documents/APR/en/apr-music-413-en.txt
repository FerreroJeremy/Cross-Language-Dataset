i just made a comment on "get yer ya ya's out" of the stones but for me the live album "who" (same time) is otherwise as good as the best stones show. daltrey, townshend, keith moon and bassist fabulous john entwistle gave us what we can do best in rock. listen to "heaven and hell," "summertime blues" cochran, "shakin all over" by johnny kidd, "my generation", "young man blues "or" magic bus ". to me it's the rock. to return to the stones c "is not inevitable that it will be for" satisfaction "," jumpin jack flash "... etc. réécoutez these discs you who are fans of rock. since the punk movement, unfortunately nothing happens. pity. oh i forgot some girls who provide a lot (amy winehouse and my discovery gabrielle cilmi).
