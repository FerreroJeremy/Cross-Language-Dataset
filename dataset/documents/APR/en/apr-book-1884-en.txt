book for a teacher of literature very informative, but a beginning in literature this book is hard to read, it hangs too throughout the book. it is difficult to read. i would not recommend it if you do not read too much. it tells a lot about the war, and even in those other places just referring to the war. text fairly criticized for his anti-semitism and misogyny. it happens during the period 14-18. must put things in context. but to understand the whole metaphor of the book and its ambivalence should read it a dozen times. not a very good book for a mere amateur.
