both say right away, this latest installment of harper is not the most original of his discography. not that the artist has to make special musical innovation at each of its output but it is clear that continuity is more than presents with this album. however, registered in the emergency (in 7 days in paris), it seems that these short periods are beneficial to prevent ben harper to ask too many questions and arguing about its production. accordingly, the disc sounds right all along, not pouring any excess, either one way or the other and it is a very good thing. and finally, how does not love an album with such a beautiful song as a tribute to paris?
