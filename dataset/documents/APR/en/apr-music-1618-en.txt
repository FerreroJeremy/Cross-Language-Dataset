neal morse no end to debit his religious nonsense. this time, he explains in an enlightening interview, a friend came to see as god had told him that neal morse was to write an album about the history of the tabernacle. and now, again in this interview, neal told us that initially he did not feel at the height of such a "divine mission" to great fanfare but with prayers he still accept to initiate this disc. more than ever involved in the movement "christian rock" and the religious institution, morse bêtifie completely. the texts are not simply unbearable by their blind faith and smug but simply dangerous obscurantism which he develops the message. impossible for me to ignore these words therefore can not accept this disk. two minutes yet completely magical and out of all context: a solo monster, reversing, an incredible innovation of steve hackett. otherwise, we can only reject this concept album.
