it's really sad to see that cornell made his solo career. after a good first solo album followed by a mediocre second album, one of the greatest vocalist of the rock / grunge was addicted to the music completely overdone and tasteless. live, the songs sound better in fact because they are rearranged, with the guitar notament, but those who expect to find here the world of cornell will be extremely disappointed.
