the topic was initially very interesting, even exciting: in pictures tell the story of john a. keel (see his book) on what happened in west virginia, at point pleasant in the mid 60s. unfortunately, we have chosen the way of narrative fiction more suited qu'honteuse the form of a disjointed film that shows us everything except what we want to see. having read the book before seeing the film, i can attest to the apparent mismatch between it and the film. one can easily enjoy the movie without having read the book, but when you see all the wealth that was available in this true story, one can only be disappointed
