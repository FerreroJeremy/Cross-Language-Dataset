and yes, listening to this album was the biggest slap in my life even after years of listening to metal or rock bands of all kinds. i found this music in everything i was looking for: humor / delirium, power, rage, psychedelia, and wonderful moments in short, an album of songs with very different, musicians exeptional ... to even live!
