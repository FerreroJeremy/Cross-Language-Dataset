the authors' approach is more sociology than economics, which could provide a new and interesting light on the question of money. the first chapters are thus devoted to criticizing the orthodox economic assumptions such as the creation of value through peaceful exchanges, neutrality of money, homo economicus and the neoclassical utility. they explain with reason they do not want to base their theory on the concept of value, to avoid falling into the contradictions of the labor value of marx. regarding the introduction of money, the authors summed up their account the excellent description of the theory of menger, but denying the idea that money can not be a commodity. for them, money is a "total social fact" that focuses the "abuse of market exchange" and requires state intervention to regulate both the violence and inspire confidence (hence the title) . from there, the book falls into a postmodern gibberish at the edge of quackery. the depreciation of currencies metal by successive rulers and governments is presented as a necessary intervention to prevent the risk of deflation. the separation of cash and unit of account (livre tournois), the innovative practice of allowing the sovereign practice devaluations (euphemistically called "monetary changes"). in short, it is understood, it is a praise to the influence of state on the currency. the fans appreciate, those who know the monetary history of the 20th century, unless ... the book has a failing practice: he has no table of contents. here's one: 1) the process of founding the order merchant 2) merchandise and currency, the mimetic hypothesis 3) currency and society 4) the trajectories of the currency 5) the monetary systems and their crises 6) the vicissitudes of u.s. monetary policy 7) the contemporary crises of finance liberalized 8) innovations and monetary prospects at the turn of the millennium
