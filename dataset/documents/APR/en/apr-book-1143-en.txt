the book is long to read along because his writing is "tight", that is to say, the more accurate of a specialist as a journalist. long also because the description of books and libraries destroyed seems like a real indictment! we suspect, since the destruction - he would say the destruction! - library of alexandria, there were whole areas of knowledge and cultures destroyed forever ... but at this point? blame it on bad luck, integration and human stupidity ... nowadays a lack of space too. while some rulers (even muslims!) was trying to gather knowledge, the next destroyed everything ... at the end of the book, we ask about the merits day book (of jack lang) that flushes the libraries every year just works consulted, we appreciate the measures the magnitude of the mess the bnf, we will ask questions about how modern conservation books (microfilm or scan) or incorrectly used too long to implement. the book is an invitation to reread "1984" by g. orwell and "fahrenheit 451" by r. bradbury
