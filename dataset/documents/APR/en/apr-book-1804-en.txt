the book is a compilation of comments on the couple's relationship to his clothes. he wants fun and illustrated on a subject objectively atypical. the fact remains that the sociological thesis of the author (even recognized by his peers) is not exciting. the reading is tedious and a sense of circling rapidly invades the reader. obviously, it is difficult to compare playing a sociological argument with a literary work but my humble decision to drive this book is extremely severe . one of my worst reading.
