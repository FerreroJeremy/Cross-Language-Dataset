already i felt very very right tommy, quadrophenia but is even worse! the problem is the same as for tommy: the who did not take the ramp on 4 sides in a row. even if the concept by a very good idea, group is lost by too much diversity among hard rock, prog rock and country! otherwise once again the ugly synths are there! and to make matters worse the mix is completely missed (tell pete)!
