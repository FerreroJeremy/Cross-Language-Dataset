i was attracted to this book with the title which i love. this is the story of a young woman fanny after 2 pregnancies began gradually to lose the hearing. before becoming completely deaf she wanted to learn to play the piano. louis is a man who just lost his brother in an accident, he accompanied his sister in law for his birth where he will make the acquaintance of fanny, who is a midwife. louis decided to see fanny every thursday to teach him the piano. yet these two links will bind. a fine first novel, which mixes scenes of childbirth funny, touching and sad scenes of tenderness as she tries to learn the piano and discovers little by little notes starting to fade. a fine book that really touched me.
