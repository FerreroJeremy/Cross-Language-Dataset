it took over 10 years to cure me of brainwashing received from my childhood by the catholic church and understand that it was ridiculed christianity and christ! this brainwashing or conditioning unimaginable to the result that the "christian" churches think really live christianity as they are kept in infantilism, they are as jacques ellul happy fools who and who nietzsche did say that the greatest irony is universal to see christians on their knees before the opposite of the gospel! leo tolstoy also criticized the christian churches as false and cruel institutions who taught theology while a jumble or place of true christianity. those popes who have no shame in choosing financial advisors among the worst advocates of globalization as peter sutherland! strut ermine fur and approving vivisection not understanding that does not kill animals as directed, this for now ... but if one goes back one realizes that the bombers who left for hiroshima and nagasaki have been blessed by the catholic church ... and later the entire history of the church is written in letters of blood ... i told all this in my book "the journey of a revolutionary" editions edilivre! but perhaps the author has become "christian" out of these false and cruel institutions that lead the blind. this is already better, that is what a christian is pretentious. because of churches, too, a majority think it is easy to be christian, then there is nothing more difficult, as for example not intended to kill animals and also the nature and a society where everything is thought to live in this respect is virtually impossible. in any case we can approach it by being vegan / vegan, eating only organic products and ethical life of voluntary simplicity and refusing maximum allopathy! also boycotting maximum lobbies of all kinds and denouncing globalization ....
