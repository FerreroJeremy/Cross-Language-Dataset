i do not understand how one could write that book about jean ziegler "the strategy of the author seems to boil down to rock a gratuitous accusation and unfounded" see evidence of a visitor here. this book instead provides quantity equally damning evidence against the cosmocrats (a term coined by ziegler) starving tens of millions of people around the world, through amongst other things, "debt" that is strangling the economies of third world countries. the overcrowding is dangerous for the wealthy without hearts, who shamelessly exploit their profits only the material resources of these countries. profit is their sole reason for living. each pages ziegler show us all their inhumanity. these are the gravediggers each year millions of "poor". a new revolution is needed for that is changing, but our country "rich" they really want? are not we already condemned ourselves when we talk about purchasing power? because in our societies consume goods fed increasingly seems the only thing that most concerns most of us ... this book is highly recommended.
