god knows i loved björk, especially when she played the mischievous fairies come from the far north to mix pop and electronic mischievously: from "vespertine", she called herself a "hard winter" i got ... and this album does not warm the atmosphere. far from his spring debut (her "debut"), björk multiplies the vocal collaborations, which make this disc often resembles a parade of monsters in the circus. the duo with the wise old robert wyatt is still remarkable (but who needs it?), but remains difficult to seduce us ... in kind "voice" i weigh or even diamanda galas (at the other end) celine dion. too bad.
