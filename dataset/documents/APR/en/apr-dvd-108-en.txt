i also read critque negative on this issue br, but reading reviews and being a fan of this movie, i decided to buy it. i would not call the game its a simple dts for the french version! regarding image not worry about big plans, but plans on how large disappointment of many defects at the sky and that on any sequence, lack of definition by example the time of entry comode of rome. in short for me the image is not natural as what technology does not necessarily mean qualities. i prefer to conclude for now by far the dvd version long version unpublished edition 3 dvd!
