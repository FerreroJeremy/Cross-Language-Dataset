i was astonished to see through the comments that amazonautes not share my opinion. i must therefore put a large flat in this film. so take a script and dialogues naive and stereotyped characters in psychology though limited, stir all the sauce and hollywood ca gives about this (i exaggerate only): then a super cool teacher full of good will is bent on helping these young people out of violence, hatred can be so colorful. it is therefore in its class asians, blacks, and latinos (bah oui must not forget) one white (which was very scared in this class). the teacher will overcome many difficulties to help these young people will take in the face of abundant contentment "nan you but we understand it is not like you is our life ..." brief the task seems daunting. will it get there? i let you see. go cease to be wicked, we will say that the game player is not bad (not without exeption) and we appreciate the presence of a very good rb. in short, a film rent when it was really, really, no other idea on a weekday evening ps i put 2 stars because i m'attedais a shootout at the end but they did not dare push the deputy so far!
