i've never been a big fan of fan films "the matrix". but one thing impressed me during the viewing of the trilogy: the music. it is obvious that those who liked the films regain the soundscape of the third film in this album as rich musically as bo first two films. for others, especially béophiles, this cd is also a little happiness in the sense that the composer don davis music book more rounded and controlled for the previous two episodes (and already at that time was not bad). a powerful brassy music, the sublime orchestral outbursts, explosions choirs ... in short, a score of action not to miss for those who love this genre. "neodämmerung" perfectly illustrates my point. to listen before buying, however, that no risk can not be to please everyone.
