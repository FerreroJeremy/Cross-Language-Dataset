this book falls into my hands while i just lost my old father of 94 years. he said the words, this book, the words i needed ... the words were in my head, i found on the pages. for cons, i was fortunate to be at peace with my dad, so i write "dad" and not "father". i had the time to reconcile, clear up misunderstandings, to forgive offenses that do not want to be so. as the author, my parents were born just before world war i, they have experienced the brunt ii. and after i was born. as for repair anything that was missed ... and it is heavy to carry mission ... so i have much to share with the author ... i also do not always say the words, in gestures, it was the right time ... but this book allows us to say goodbye in serenity. good night to the prince, the gardener, to those who go and we can keep that through a few emotions that words can conjure. because there is no flint to keep emotions.
