we find (almost) all the hits of megadeth: blackmail the universe set the world afire wake the dead, in my darkest hour, she-wolf reckoning day, to everyone, hangar 18 &amp; return to hangar, i 'll be there, tornado of souls, trust, something that i'm not, kick the flesh, coming home, symphony of destruction, peace sells, holy wars. bonus: symphony of destruction with a different mix. compared to the double cd, it lacks skin o 'my teeth (unfortunately, because this is my favorite), "die dead enough and angry again. the argentine public is unleashed. on the riff symphony of destruction, he sings "megadeth" megadeth "we love megadeth!". at hangar 18, he sings "megadeth! megadeth! megadeth!" between solos. even stronger: he sings the solo at the end of she wolf. the price is very interesting. minor regrets: i prefer marty friedman on guitar.
