disappointed! first album was much better .. i love the titles in the likes of "black horse and the cherry tree" or the cover of "i want you back" that kt had at taratata. y'avait life in the song and it was much more folk and acoustic. the album is drastic fantasy of pop with pailettes is bland ... kt has lost something. this lack of authenticity!
