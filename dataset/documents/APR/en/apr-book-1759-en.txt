very very very disappointing. a little history inventive humor and nonexistent extra-terrestrial. i had been disappointed by previous (the potion euphoric and nice dolphins traviata and compiling stories only appeared to make more money from the gallic back ...) but there will be the last for which i spend money. to say that the author has dared to say that after him there would be no sequel to asterix because he feared that another author did not respect the spirit of the series ... well i think he did not actually need a successor to do!
