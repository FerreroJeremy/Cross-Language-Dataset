it is not worth entice the barge with kristin scott thomas and his so-called super benefit no one sees a few minutes in the film. film very boring because too stringy ah! no, this is not hitchcock! as for the accent: sometimes there are subtitles and often forgotten when they are needed. go and see "the law of silence" even if a date just not sounding like that movie. the english dialogues are clearer on the soundtrack that some replicas quebec!
