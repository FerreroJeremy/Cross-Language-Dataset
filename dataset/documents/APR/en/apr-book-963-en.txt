mathieu laine is presumptuous arguments easily, without consistency could be responsible for the crime of high treason against the french state because the state is actually dis-empowering a state feeder. mr laine thinks it that we should question the social protection system dear to our poorest countrymen? with the wool liberal, was quick to find an economic apartheid in which a small minority of rich crush the little people in making their rhetoric while pointing to the front of their starving children. his paradise is a glass building built in the middle of the favelas from which the golden boys are throwing their garbage on what they see as already garbage other men. a state which condones the rich, i prefer the state disempowers poor. shame on you mr. wool!
