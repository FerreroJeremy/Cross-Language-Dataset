the writing is fine, the story hangs when it reads. the novel reads without hooked. the idea is good and well orchestrated. often funny and well regarded, occasionally pathetic or sluggish, the history is well turned. this is a good time that we pass ... but this novel is good when the time, however with hindsight, i realize that nothing remains.
