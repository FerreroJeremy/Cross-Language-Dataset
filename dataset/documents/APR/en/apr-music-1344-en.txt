an explosive cocktail menu for this 1st album from english: psyche sounds, pop melodies, morning of a cross between my bloody valentine and nirvana! shake, to give any treatment mechanic (ie production too polished) and you get everything that raise! despite this promising start and high quality albums later, the group does not really mark the minds and will remain confidential, behind groups more "standardized" grunge like ned's atomic dustbin ... bad example!
