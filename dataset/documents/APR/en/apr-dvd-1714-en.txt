the original version is beautiful is present in this package. it's still a minimum for a collector's edition. ^ ^ as for the series is a reference. the drawings are superb, and although the animation is not special (everyone can not afford to use 24 frames per second), this anime is very enjoyable to watch. lodoss does not revolutionize the genre, but brings a little more to the world of heroic fantasy. on the side of the dvd, the sound and image of the first episode are slightly different on mine. but i did not find this flaw in the following.
