the adaptation of biblical stories seem a favorite theme studios. this new version has its volume ie 2 boxes of 5 dvds. although recent, this realization is very disappointing indeed. certainly, do not expect historical accuracy in these adventures still a fantastic bonus dvd to remember the historical truth of the time would have been welcome. but the devil at the time of production as troy or the lord of the rings could expect better. here everything is asseptisé and solemn. the crisp passes, violent or funny have been erased which is inconceivable given the number of dvds. in short, the show does not go to you and that is what we seek in the peplum especially also with a theme so often treated in film and television.
