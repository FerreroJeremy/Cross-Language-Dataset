i am obliged to return this product my however sophisticated reader refuses to read: "wrong disc" he said! my car radio does not know either! i have the impression that the product protected by an anti-copy can not be played on all devices! what a pity! i would have requested an exchange but i am afraid that the result is the same, i will still not change the stereo, then i demand a refund ... thank you and no hard feelings!
