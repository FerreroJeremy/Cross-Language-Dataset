gorgeous! everything that made the reputation of yes is present on this album: great waxing lyrical, sumptuous keyboards, guitar and bass very acrobatic technique. a short album (re) discovered. the keyboards are not required here by rick wakeman, but by patrick moraz is excellent synths without falling into easy and free demonstration. the quiet moments alternate with great flights of the group.
