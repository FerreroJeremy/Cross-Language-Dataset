oh but it is beautiful this nanard, this treasure of bad taste, this farce in which buyers and spectators are turkeys! the diiférence between coarseness and vulgarity is definitely flattened by this horror film, i advise inarritu, eastwwod and scorsese, who have no idea what can be done with a camera. this is a twisted story, even in the times, love and sordid dégué ..., told as a fairy tale in the tropics. it sucks, badly played, incredible, but it has at least one great merit: to show the world (well just one who has watched this thing to the end), catherine d., icon of cinema in paris, is neither an actress nor a singer. a guard then as evidence of the said thing.
