this is one of those discs that has had a long life in my house - i had the first soundtrack of star wars on cassette tape, then when that broke (from being overplayed), i got the vinyl version (so i could re-record the tracks in a better order). when that record set got worn and poppy, i got the cd, and then when this special edition came out, i got it too. so, i guess one could say that this is a perennial favorite.
