take me away (out of this place)! first title of the second album tatts sums up what will happen if you stay there. both the former had known you expect (!), as the second will crush you, cut you into pieces. even if you try to flee, you will not escape unscathed after the second tsunami. it takes full head like angry when he messed up his microphone in blows ball at concerts (killing?) ridden his band. no hesitation to have: this album is missing the first one to finish you off, making it essential for fans and any music lover brutal and direct.
