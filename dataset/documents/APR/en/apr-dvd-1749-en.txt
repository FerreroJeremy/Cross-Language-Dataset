intrigued by the glowing reviews of some great filmmakers of gore movies, i was in all rather disappointed by this movie. say it is not what i expected (what i expect is actually implied at the end). this is certainly not unpleasant but it does not leave a lasting impression. features of curiosity, nothing more.
