i did not know that game existed for this story, since what matters here is a movie .. start good atmosphere, good ideas, a city in fog, demonic mermaid, suspension, and one begins to appreciate again the siren and what it entails and then .. and then .. everything becomes weak and limited ridiculissime and this time i let go, wondering how we could start so well and pick up as we fall into a puddle of mud .. so here, the 2 stars are for the first note the rest of the film would be unhealthy for me
