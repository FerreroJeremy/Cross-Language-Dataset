i'll start with the things i like about this book. werber i think that shows a real feat for its imaginative realm of the gods, and particularly like the fact that punctuates the stories of pieces of mythology greek. the book is interesting, it leads the reader, and despite the assassination of the book i'll deliver, i can not because of giving up the plot there is. by cons, and here it goes degenerate, i think the story as a whole, evokes dreams of youth confined. first, the characters: is what i'm alone in the world to find a book that is crying marylin monroe "love as a shield, the sword'humour as' there is something that goes wrong? i will not insist that mr. werber becomes houellebecqesque, but i can not stifle a chuckle cynical reading almost all the dialogues between these personages mawkish and insipid. indeed mr. pinson, personage they do not particularly want it will overcome and triumph in the realm of the gods constantly - like a blockbuster u.s. - find unconditional love in spite of its pairs of very large defects of personality, enjoy a legendary opportunities (even for a god) and exasperate the gallery with such affectations. indeed, the violence that exceeds that deicide, it flies on winged horses, he made love with mata hari (?). where are these stories corny and frankly unbelievable even if the subject - the realm of the gods, held in ancient greece - is pretty hilarious too. you turn each page after another, we read more and faster. myself i expect only the next section on these ultraviolent greek gods, or perhaps a recipe for apple pie box in the middle of the book ... if not, history does not. read this book, but do not take seriously what i i almost do wrong. you might be disappointed.
