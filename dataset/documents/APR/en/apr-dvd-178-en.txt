i think it is a moment where the guise of paying tribute to a type of film, or a director, one in the dark throughout the film we wanted to show i explain: tarantino wants to pay tribute to films "grindhouse" in the 70s, the z series where the scenario is not important or is nonexistent. so, we made a film in its sauce of course, where there's no scenarios, where the characters are engaging in anti-possible, all worked with an image to be the ugliest possible. . . let's say that after his tribute to the film kung-fu, we expected something else: his next film will be what? a tribute to films of the 80s in the image half disorder, gender de palma? i could not help but compare the scene of the movie where the girls talk about the car they want to try (although it lasts 10 minutes), with the start of "reservoir dogs" where the characters talk about madonna: it's simple, it is day and night. in one, every word makes me laugh, it's late-in-the-rudeness is really well seen in the other, you want to press the "fast forward" to our remote after two minutes. accident scene and a chase car is not enough to make a film. quentin, where have you been?
