in schumann, walter gieseking game seems oddly detached, outside the declaration of love which is illustrated in this breviary of ardent romantic piano. "affetuoso allegro" is dispersed in atmospheres capricious, with surprising shifts in mood. soloist and orchestra ripple in the wind never capture the speech. the pace and the intermezzo seek more nuance that affect. the finale seems too careless. the phrasing, as played by fingertips, are hardly comprehensive, hands get tired looking for a precision that is not. and the orchestra knows passes and shifts in vacuum. despite the fluidity of the dresden-based panels, subtly inspired by karl böhm, this interpretation fails to fix a little atmosphere and sometimes seems to suffer the partition rather than illustrate. admirers of the german pianist will remain true to his testimony the later, accompanied by furtwängler and karajan. fortunately, the rest of the program takes over this disappointment and justifies the "5 stars" of the evaluation: the introduction of lightning grieg concerto announces a particularly grim reading of the allegro molto moderato, vivid colors fauvist. accompaniment hans rosbaud is very attentive to revive this thriller twists: listen for example ropes ruminate a bad conscience shortly before the conclusion (around 10'40). between dogs and wolves, an adagio for starched languor falsely leads to a diabolical end, sometimes at the edge of ferocity. that denies any affiliation chopinesque and could announce more virtuosity engine and expressionist future concertos of the twentieth century yet to come. .. the most interesting testimony on this disc is still what pass for a mere adjunct of the program: "symphonic variations" by franck, recorded in 1932. sir henry wood deploys huge range of stamps from the london philharmonic, buzzing colors, denying academicism of the work. gieseking prose with modesty and discretion, but we did however hear an abundant imagination and narrative.
