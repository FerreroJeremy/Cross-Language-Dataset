the beginning of the film is mysterious and exciting: we have two young people who are pursued by a strange truck whose driver - who has little to humans (they would later appercevront) - "play" with the bodies of his victims ... a little horror movie with no pretensions to become throughout the film much more interesting than it looks: the scenario is not necessarily predictable, the special effects are of good quality and climate strange and horrific. note: the film contains a scene or génialissime especially the main characters find themselves while they are pursued by the monster in front of the house of an old lady, raising dozens of cats (amazing shadows ...) . in short, we spent a very long time before this movie full of surprises ... see!!
