this double album is not the berezina or the titanic, but it is not far! already with "close to the edge" we fast approaching! yes, i am one of those people who have never caught these 2 loukoums pretentious (yes fans call it the 'chef d'oeuvre'!!!... major gods !!!). no, definitely "the yes album", "fragile", "relay" (which consists of long sequences but which are not sterile!) and even "tormato" and "drama" (with the 2 references to this, i'm cursed forever by the fans) have much more substance. there's no picture! ... are some interesting passages (alas, it's never enough to make a great album, let alone a double album !!!).
