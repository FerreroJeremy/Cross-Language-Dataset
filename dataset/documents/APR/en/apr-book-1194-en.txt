i found a taxi mauve quite by chance. when i started reading it, i did not want to base the book. i wanted it never ends. immerse yourself in the story and be enchanted by the irish scenery, beautiful and mysterious and endearing characters. the story of the protagonist is such that the reader likes to believe that the author and character are one. a taxi mauve was the first novel i read michel deon when i was 17 years. today i have 8 more and i appreciate greatly the work of deon. if you dream of escape, please follow the guide. with its attractive style and emotion communication, the author allows you to travel without you needing to leave home.
