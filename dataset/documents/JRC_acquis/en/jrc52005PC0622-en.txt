COM(2005) 622 final 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The quota amount for certain autonomous Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period. In response to requests from several Member States, the Commission's departments, together with the government experts concerned, considered whether to open, increase, extend or close autonomous tariff quotas for certain industrial products. | 
General context On 20 December 1996 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products so that Community demand for the products in question could be met under the most favourable conditions. New Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for such products. Discussions at meetings of the Economic Tariff Questions Group showed that the Member States were ready to open, increase, extend or close quotas for the products covered by the proposal for a Regulation, without disturbing the markets for such products. | 
Provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 (OJ L 345, 31.12.1996). Regulation last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1151/2005 (OJ L 185, 16.7.2005). | 
Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union The proposal is in line with agricultural, trade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. |

Choice of instruments | 
Proposed instruments: Regulation | 
Other instruments would not be appropriate for the following reasons: By virtue of Article 26 of the EC Treaty autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas are approved by the Council acting on a qualified majority on the basis of a Commission proposal. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 
Uncollected customs duties | 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | 
Repeal of existing legislation Adopting this proposal will mean some legislation must be repealed. | 
Review/revision/sunset clause |

Recasting The proposal involves recasting existing legislation. | 
1. Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Whereas: 
(1) On 20 December 1996 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products.[2] Community demand for the products in question is to be met under the most favourable conditions. New Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, and certain existing tariff quotas should be extended, without disturbing the markets for these products. 
(2) Since the quota amount for certain Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of Community industry for the current quota period, these tariff quotas should be increased with effect from 1 January 2005 and adjusted with effect from 1 January 2006. 
(3) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant Community tariff quotas in 2006 for certain products on which duties were suspended in 2005. These products should therefore be removed from the table in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96. 
(4) In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 to be replaced in its entirety. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.
