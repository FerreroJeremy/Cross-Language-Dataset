COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 348/81 of 20 January 1981 on common rules for imports of whales or other cetacean products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1917/80 (2), and in particular Article 3 (1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 of 28 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in certain products listed in Annex II to the Treaty (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1117/78 (4), and in particular Article 2 (1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (5), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (6), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (7), 
Whereas the conservation of cetacean species calls for measures which will restrict international trade ; whereas these should be Community-level measures and should at the same time respect the Community's international obligations; 
Whereas, pending the adoption at Community level of more general measures concerning the supervision of trade in species of wild fauna and flora, imports of the main whale or other cetacean products should be subject, in an initial stage, to import permits, while the possibility of extending the list of these products is also reserved ; whereas, in order to clarify the situation, it may be useful to note that, pending this possible extension, the Member States continue to be competent for taking, in compliance with the Treaty, measures for the protection of the species relating to imports of products not covered by this Regulation ; whereas the competent authorities should not issue such permits unless they have assured themselves that the products in question are not to be used for commercial purposes, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
