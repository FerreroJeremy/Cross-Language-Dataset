4. the passenger car models are grouped and listed separately according to fuel type (e.g. petrol or diesel etc.). Within each fuel type, models are ranked in order of increasing CO2 emissions, with the model with the lowest official fuel consumption being placed at the top of the list; 
5. for each passenger car model in the list the make, the numerical value of the official fuel consumption and the official specific emissions of CO2 are given. The value of the official fuel consumption is expressed in either litres per 100 kilometres (l/100 km), kilometres per litre (km/l), or an appropriate combination of these, and is quoted to one decimal place. The official specific emissions of CO2 are quoted to the nearest whole number in grams per kilometre (g/km). 
Such values may be expressed in different units (gallons and miles) to the extent compatible with the provisions of Directive 80/181/EEC.

CO2 is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming%quot%; in the case of a display featuring an electronic screen this message must be permanently visible; 
8. the poster/display will be updated at least every six months. Where an electronic display is used, the information shall be updated at least every three months;
