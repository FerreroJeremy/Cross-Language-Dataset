THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

(4) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000 outlines the information that has to be provided by the person responsible for placing the respective substance on the market in order to carry out the evaluation programme. If the information for a particular substance does not become available within one year of adoption of that Regulation, the Commission should be informed when it would be possible to submit the information. 
(5) Within the first year of the evaluation programme, the persons responsible for placing on the market the substances contained in the register, via the European Flavour and Fragrance Association, have submitted data for part of the substances listed in Decision 1999/217/EC and informed the Commission of the dates on which data for the remaining substances could be submitted. 
(6) In order to allow the smooth running of the evaluation process, the Commission is now in a position to establish deadlines for the submission of the information referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
