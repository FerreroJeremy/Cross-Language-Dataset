amending Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001 laying down the marketing standard for citrus fruit 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 453/2002(4), laid down provisions on the quality, the sizing, the presentation and the marking of citrus fruit. 
(2) The standard for citrus fruit recommended by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has recently been amended and includes the possibility to size fruit by count, new provisions with regards to the uniformity in size and the possibility to pack citrus fruit of different species in the same consumer package. 
(3) It is moreover appropriate to clarify several current provisions. Firstly, size 1-X being traditionally marketed under the designation %quot%1%quot%, an alternative denomination is needed. Secondly, minimum juice contents applicable to the different varieties of oranges shall be updated. Lastly, it is appropriate to stipulate that the labelling requirement with regards to preserving agents only applies to post-harvest treatments. 
(4) It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1
