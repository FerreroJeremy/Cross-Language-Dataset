Commission Regulation (EC) No 1010/2006 
of 3 July 2006 
on certain exceptional market support measures in the eggs and poultry sector in certain Member States 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs [1], and in particular point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 14(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat [2], and in particular point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 14(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Because of occurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in areas near the Community since the autumn of 2005 and in several Member States since February 2006, the consumption of poultrymeat and, to a lesser extent, of eggs, has fallen appreciably in some Member States. 
(2) The sharp and significant fall in the consumption of poultrymeat has led to a fall in prices. The poultrymeat market has suffered serious disruption as a result. 
(3) Since this serious market disruption is directly linked to a loss of consumer confidence arising from risks to animal health, it is justified, at the request of the Member States concerned, to adopt exceptional market support measures as referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 and to grant aid to offset part of the financial losses resulting from the destruction of eggs for hatching or chicks, the early partial slaughter of breeding flocks, the temporary fall in production, or the slaughter of ready-to-lay pullets, given the preventive biosafety measures imposed by some Member States. 
(4) The compensation paid for eggs for hatching that are processed into egg products must be less than that for eggs for hatching that are destroyed. 
(5) The maximum quantities eligible for financial compensation in respect of each exceptional market support measure should be fixed by the Commission after scrutinising the applications received from Member States. 
(6) The measures adopted pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 have been in force since 11 May 2006. This Regulation should therefore also be applicable from that date. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. The destruction of eggs for hatching falling within CN codes 04070011 and 04070019 shall be regarded as an exceptional market support measure pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75.
