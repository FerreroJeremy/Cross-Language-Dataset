COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2264/91 of 26 July 1991 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78 on the importation of hops from non-member countries 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organization of the market in hops (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (2), and in particular Articles 5 (3) and 18 thereof, 
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 provides that hops and hop products from non-member countries may be imported only if their quality standards are at least equivalent to the minimum limits adopted for like products harvested within the Community or their derivatives; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 4060/88 (4), specifies two types of attestations by which proof can be furnished that the requirements specified in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 have been satisfied; 
Whereas practice has shown that import procedures would become more efficient, and that respect of Community rules on certification could be ensured better if use of control attestations were abolished; 
Whereas, in order to avoid inappropriate inconvenience to certain operators in the sector, further use of the control attestation should be permitted during a transitional period in the case of hops originating from countries which have not authorized certain agencies to issue attestations of equivalence; whereas, to avoid abuse of the control attestation, such an attestation should be issued only if the origin of the hop consignment has been proved; 
Whereas, in order to ensure that Community rules on the certification of hops are respected, Member States should carry out checks to verify whether imported hops conform to the minimum marketing requirements; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Hops, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
