Protocol 
setting out, for the period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles 
Article 1 
Period of application and fishing opportunities 
1. For a period of six years from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities granted under Article 2 of the Agreement shall be as follows: 
(a) 40 ocean-going tuna seiners, and 
(b) 12 surface longliners. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 4 and 5. 
3. Under Article 4 of the Agreement, vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Community may engage in fishing activities in the Seychelles waters only if they are in possession of a fishing licence issued under this Protocol in accordance with the Annex. 
Article 2 
Financial contribution — Methods of payment 
1. For the period referred to in Article 1, the financial contribution referred to in Article 6 of the Agreement shall be EUR 24 750 000. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 4, 6 and 8. 
3. The Community shall pay the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 at the rate of EUR 4125000 per year during the period of application of this Protocol. 
4. If the total quantity of tuna catches per year by Community vessels in Seychelles' waters exceeds 55000 tonnes, the total annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 75 per additional tonne of tuna caught. However, the total annual amount to be paid by the Community cannot exceed EUR 8250000. 
5. Payment shall be made no later than 30 September 2005 for the first year and no later than the anniversary date of the Protocol for the following years. 
6. Subject to Article 6 herewith, Seychelles shall have full discretion regarding the use to which this financial contribution is put. 
7. The financial contribution shall be paid into no more than two Public Treasury accounts opened with the Seychelles Central Bank. 
Article 3 
Cooperation on responsible fishing 
1. The two Parties hereby undertake to promote responsible fishing in Seychelles waters based on the principle of non-discrimination between the different fleets fishing in those waters. 
2. Based on the recommendations and resolutions taken within the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the best available scientific advice and, where appropriate after a joint meeting of scientists, the two parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement and, where necessary, agree on the measures to ensure the sustainable management of fisheries resources. 
Article 4 
Review of fishing opportunities 
1. The fishing opportunities referred to in Article 1 may be increased by mutual agreement insofar as the conclusions of the joint meeting of scientists referred to in Article 3(2) confirm that such an increase will not endanger the sustainable management of Seychelles' resources. In this case the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) shall be increased proportionately and pro rata temporis. However, the total amount of the financial contribution paid by the European Community shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in Article 2(1). In the event that the quantities caught by Community fishing vessels exceed the quantity which correspond to the total amount of financial contribution, the Parties shall consult each other as soon as possible in order to establish the amount due for the quantity caught in excess of this limit. 
2. Conversely, if the parties agree to reduce the fishing opportunities provided for in Article 1, the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionally and pro rata temporis. 
3. The allocation of the fishing opportunities among different categories of vessels may also be reviewed by mutual agreement between the parties, provided that any changes comply with any recommendations or resolutions adopted by the IOTC regarding the management of stocks liable to be affected by such redistribution. The parties shall agree on the corresponding adjustment of the financial contribution where the redistribution of fishing opportunities so warrants. 
Article 5 
New fishing opportunities 
1. In the event that Community fishing vessels are interested in engaging in fisheries not provided for in Article 1, the Parties shall consult each other before authorisation is granted for any such activities and, where appropriate, agree to the conditions for such fishing, including effecting corresponding amendments to this Protocol and the Annex thereto. 
2. The Parties should encourage experimental fishing, specially relating to deep water species present in Seychelles waters. To this end and on the request of one party, they shall consult each other and determine on a case-by-case basis the species, conditions and other parameters that are relevant. 
The Parties shall carry out experimental fishing in accordance with parameters that will be agreed by both Parties in an administrative arrangement where appropriate. The authorisations for experimental fishing should be agreed for a maximum period of six months. 
In the event that the Parties consider that experimental campaigns have yielded positive results, the Government of Seychelles may allocate fishing possibilities of the new species to the community fleet until the expiration of the present protocol. The financial compensation referred to in Article 2(1) shall consequently be increased. 
Article 6 
Suspension and review of the payment of the financial contribution 
1. Where as a result of circumstances solely attributable to the fault or negligence of Seychelles, fishing activities in Seychelles waters cannot be carried out in Seychelles waters, the European Community may, after prior consultation with Seychelles, suspend payment of the financial contribution provided that the Community has paid in full any amounts due at the time of suspension. 
2. Payment of the financial contribution shall recommence once the situation has returned to normal and following consultation and agreement between the two Parties confirming that the situation is likely to allow a return to normal fishing activities. 
Article 7 
Promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in Seychelles waters 
1. A share of at least 36 % of the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) shall be put towards defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Seychelles with a view to promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in its waters. This contribution shall be managed in the light of objectives identified by mutual agreement between the two Parties, and the annual and multiannual programming relating thereto. 
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, as soon as this Protocol enters into force and no later than three months after that date, the Community and Seychelles shall agree, within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement, on a multiannual sectoral programme and detailed implementing rules covering, in particular: 
(a) annual and multiannual guidelines for using the percentage of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1; 
(b) the objectives, both annual and multiannual, to be achieved with a view to introducing, over time, responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries, taking account of the priorities expressed by Seychelles in its national fisheries policy and other policies relating to or having an impact on the promotion of responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries; 
(c) criteria and procedures for evaluating the results obtained each year. 
3. Any proposed amendments to the multiannual sectoral programme must be approved by both parties within the Joint Committee. 
4. Each year, Seychelles shall allocate the percentage of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 with a view to implementing the multiannual programme. For the first year of application of the Protocol, that allocation must be notified to the Community at the time when the multiannual sectoral programme is approved within the Joint Committee. For each year thereafter, Seychelles shall notify the Community of the allocation no later than 1 December of the previous year. 
5. Where the annual evaluation of the progress made in implementing the multiannual sectoral programme so warrants, the European Community may ask, with the approval of the Joint Committee, for the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) to be modified with a view to bringing the actual amount of financial resources allocated to implementation of the programme into line with its results. 
Article 8 
Disputes — suspension of application of the Protocol 
1. Any dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of this Protocol or its application shall be the subject of consultations between the parties within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement, in a special meeting if necessary. 
2. Without prejudice to Article 9, application of the Protocol may be suspended at the initiative of one party if the dispute between the Parties is deemed to be serious and if the consultations held within the Joint Committee under paragraph 1 have not resulted in an amicable settlement. 
3. Suspension of application of the Protocol shall require the interested party to notify its intention in writing at least three months before the date on which suspension is due to take effect. 
4. In the event of suspension, the Parties shall continue to consult with a view to finding an amicable settlement to their dispute. Where such settlement is reached, application of the Protocol shall resume and the amount of the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionately and pro rata temporis according to the period during which application of the Protocol was suspended. 
Article 9 
Suspension of application of the Protocol on grounds of non-payment 
Subject to Article 3, if the European Community fails to make the payments provided for in Article 2, Seychelles may suspend the implementation of this Protocol. 
Article 10 
National law 
The activities of Community fishing vessels in Seychelles are subject to the national laws and regulations unless otherwise provided under this Protocol and the Annex thereto. 
Article 11 
Revision clause 
Following the third anniversary of this Protocol and the Annex thereto, the Parties will review the application of the Protocol and the Annex thereto and, where appropriate, consult on any amendments of their provisions. Any such amendments may include the reference tonnage and the standard amounts paid for licences and the ratio between the amount per tonne set out in Article 2(4) and the amount indicated in section 2(2) of the Annex. 
Article 12 
Repeal 
The Protocol and Annex I, dated 17 January 2002, to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles, which came into force on 28 October 1987, is hereby repealed and replaced by this Protocol and the Annex thereto.

Issue of licences 
1. Only eligible Community vessels may obtain a licence to fish in Seychelles waters under the Protocol setting out, for the period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles. 
2. For a Community vessel to be eligible, neither the owner, the master nor the vessel itself must be prohibited from fishing in Seychelles. They must be in order with the authorities of the Seychelles insofar as they must have fulfilled all prior obligations arising from their fishing activities in Seychelles under fisheries agreements concluded with the Community. 
3. All Community vessels applying for a fishing licence shall be represented by an agent resident in Seychelles. The name and address of that agent shall be stated in the licence application. 
4. The relevant Community authorities shall present to the SFA (Seychelles Fishing Authority) an application for each vessel wishing to fish under the Agreement at least 20 days before the date of commencement of the period of validity requested. However, vessel owners who have not submitted a licence application prior to the period of validity may do so, during the period of validity, no later than 20 days before the start of the fishing activities. In such cases, vessel owners shall pay the entire fees due for the full year. 
5. Applications shall be submitted to the competent authority of Seychelles on a form drawn up in accordance with the specimen in Appendix 1. 
6. All licence applications shall be accompanied by the following documents:

11. However, at the request of the European Community and where force majeure is proven, a vessel's licence shall be replaced, for the remaining period of its validity, by a new licence for another vessel whose features are similar to those of the first vessel, with no further fee due. However, if the gross registered tonnage (GRT) of the replacement vessel is above that of the vessel to be replaced, the difference in fee shall be paid pro rata temporis. 
12. The owner of the first vessel, or the agent, shall return the cancelled licence to the competent authority of Seychelles via the European Commission delegation responsible for Seychelles. 
13. The new licence shall take effect on the day that the vessel's owner returns the cancelled licence to the competent authority of Seychelles. The European Commission delegation responsible for Seychelles shall be informed of the licence transfer. 
14. The licence must be kept on board at all times, without prejudice to point 2 of Chapter IX of this Annex. 
SECTION 2 
Licence conditions — fees and advance payments 
1. Licences shall be valid for one year and are renewable. 
2. The fee shall be EUR 25 per tonne caught within Seychelles waters. 
3. Licences shall be issued once the following standard amounts have been paid to the competent national authorities: 
- EUR 15000 for tuna seiners, equivalent to the fees due for 600 tonnes of tuna and tuna‐like species caught within Seychelles waters per year, 
- EUR 3000 for surface longliners of more than 150 GRT, equivalent to the fees due for 120 tonnes of tuna and tuna-like species caught within Seychelles waters per year, 
- EUR 2250 for surface longliners of 150 GRT or less, equivalent to the fees due for 90 tonnes of tuna and tuna-like species caught within Seychelles waters per year. 
4. The SFA shall draw up a statement of fees due in respect of the previous calendar year on the basis of catch declarations by Community vessels and other information in the possession of the SFA. 
5. The statement shall be sent to the Commission before 31 March of the current year. The Commission shall transmit it before 15 April simultaneously to the shipowners and national authorities of the Member States concerned. 
6. Where the shipowners do not agree with the statement submitted by the SFA, they may consult the scientific institutes competent for verifying catch statistics such as the IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement), the IEO (Instituto Español de Oceanografia) and IPIMAR (Instituto de Investigação das Pescas e do Mar), and thereafter discuss together with the Seychelles authorities to establish the final statement before 31 May of the current year. In the absence of observations by the shipowners at that date, the statement submitted by the SFA is considered as the final one. 
7. Member States shall notify the Commission of the final statement relating to their own fleet. 
8. Shipowners shall make any additional payment to the competent Seychelles authorities at the latest by 30 June of the same year at a bank account designated by the authorities of the Seychelles in accordance with Article 2(6) of the Protocol. 
9. Where the final statement is less than the advance payment referred to in point 3, the balance shall not be recoverable by the shipowner. 
CHAPTER II 
FISHING ZONES 
To avoid any adverse effect on small-scale fisheries in Seychelles waters, fishing by Community vessels shall not be authorised in the zones defined in Seychelles legislation nor within three miles around any fish-aggregating device placed by Seychelles authorities, the geographical positions of which have been communicated to the shipowners' representatives or agents. 
CHAPTER III 
CATCH REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 
1. For the purposes of this Annex, the duration of a trip by a Community vessel shall be defined as follows: 
- either the period elapsing between entering and leaving Seychelles waters, 
- or the period elapsing between entering Seychelles waters and a transhipment, 
- or the period elapsing between entering Seychelles waters and a landing in Seychelles. 
2. All vessels authorised to fish in Seychelles waters under the Agreement shall be obliged to communicate their catches to the competent authority of Seychelles in the following manner: 
2.1. The Community vessels licensed to fish in Seychelles waters shall complete a fishing form as set out in Appendices 2 and 3, for each trip it undertakes in Seychelles waters. In the absence of catches, the fishing forms shall still be filled in. 
2.2. As far as the submission of the fishing forms referred to in points 2.1 and 2.3 is concerned, the Community vessels shall: 
- in the event they call into Port Victoria, submit the completed forms to the Seychelles authorities within five days of arrival, or in any event before it leaves port, whichever occurs first, 
- in any other case, send the completed forms to the Seychelles authorities within 14 days of arrival in any port other than Victoria. 
Copies of these fishing forms must also be sent to the scientific institutes referred to in Chapter I, section 2.6. 
2.3. The words "Outside Seychelles waters" shall be entered in the abovementioned logbook in respect of periods during which the vessel is not in Seychelles waters. 
2.4. The forms shall be filled in legibly and signed by the master of the vessel or his representative. 
3. Where the provisions set out in this Chapter are not complied with, the Government of Seychelles reserves the right to suspend the licence of the offending vessel until formalities have been completed and to apply the penalty laid down in existing Seychelles legislation. The flag Member State and the European Commission shall be informed thereof. 
CHAPTER IV 
EMBARKING SEAMEN 
1. Each tuna seiner shall take on board during its trip in Seychelles waters at least two Seychelles seamen designated by the agent of the vessel, in agreement with the shipowner, from the names on a list submitted by the competent authority of Seychelles. 
2. Shipowners shall endeavour to take on board additional Seychelles seamen. 
3. The shipowner or agent shall inform the competent authority of Seychelles of the names and particulars of the Seychelles seamen taken on board the vessel concerned, mentioning their position in the crew. 
4. The International Labour Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by EU vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
5. Seychelles seamen's employment contracts, a copy of which shall be given to the signatories, shall be drawn up between the shipowners' agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the competent authorities of Seychelles. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance and the pension benefits applicable to them. 
6. Seychelles seamen's wages shall be paid by the ship-owners. They shall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement between the ship-owners or their agents and the competent authorities of Seychelles. However, the wage conditions granted to Seychelles seamen shall not be lower than those applied to Seychelles crews performing similar duties and shall under no circumstances be below ILO standards. 
7. For the purposes of the enforcement and application of the law of employment the ship‐owner agent shall be considered as the local representative of the ship-owner. The contract concluded between the agent and the seamen shall include also the conditions for repatriation and the pension benefit applicable to them. 
8. All seamen employed aboard Community vessels shall report to the master of the vessel designated on the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to report at the date and time agreed for embarkation, ship-owners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board. 
9. Where no Seychelles seamen are taken on board for reasons other than that referred to in point 8, shipowners shall be obliged to pay a flat-rate amount equivalent to a figure based on the number of days that the vessel operated in Seychelles' waters multiplied by the amount per day which is fixed at $ 20. The flat rate amount shall be paid to the Seychelles authorities at the latest by the date set out in section 2(8) of Chapter I. 
10. That sum shall be used for the training of seamen/fishermen in Seychelles and shall be paid into an account specified by the authorities of Seychelles. 
CHAPTER V

- the names of the cargo vessels, 
- the tonnage by species to be transhipped, 
- the day of transhipment. 
5.3. Transhipment shall be considered as an exit from Seychelles waters. Vessels must therefore submit their catch declarations to the competent authorities of Seychelles. 
5.4. Any transhipment of catches not covered above shall be prohibited in Seychelles waters. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Seychelles law. 
5.5. Masters of Community fishing vessels engaged in landing or transhipment operations in a port of Seychelles shall allow and facilitate the inspection of such operations by Seychelles inspectors. Once the inspection has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel.

Appendix 4 
Provisions establishing the method to be used for the transmission of data relating to satellite monitoring of the position of ec vessels fishing under the ec/seychelles fishery agreement 
As the Republic of Seychelles has introduced a vessel monitoring system (VMS) applicable to all foreign vessels fishing in Seychelles waters, on a non-discriminatory basis, and has extended VMS surveillance to its own national fleet of the same category, and 
Considering that EC fishing vessels are already subject to satellite tracking under Community legislation since January 2000, 
It is recommended that the flag States and the authorities of the Republic of Seychelles implement satellite monitoring of Community vessels fishing under the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles in accordance with the following conditions: 
1. For the purposes of satellite monitoring, the Seychelles authorities shall communicate to the Fisheries Monitoring Centres (FMCs) of the flag States the co-ordinates (latitudes and longitudes) of the Seychelles waters. 
The Seychelles authorities will transmit this information in electronic format, expressed in degrees decimal in the Wgs-84 system datum. 
2. The Seychelles authorities and the national FMCs will exchange information on their respective electronic addresses in X.25 format or, where appropriate, another secure communication protocol and on the specifications to be used in their respective FMCs in accordance with the conditions established in points 4 and 6. This information will include, as far as possible, the names, the telephone, and fax numbers and the electronic addresses (Internet), which can be used for the general communications between the FMCs. 
3. The position of the vessels will be determined with a margin of error of less than 500 metres and with a confidence interval of 99 %. 
4. When a vessel fishing under the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles and subject to satellite tracking under Community legislation enters into Seychelles waters, subsequent position reports shall be communicated by the FMC of the flag State to the Monitoring Centre of Seychelles automatically, in real time, at least every hour (frequency). These messages are identified as Position Reports. 
5. The messages referred to in item 4 shall be transmitted electronically in X.25 format, or other secure communication protocols subject to prior agreement between the relevant FMCs. All messages will be communicated automatically, in real time, in accordance with the definitions given in Attachment 1. 
It is prohibited for a vessel to switch off its satellite tracking device when operating in Seychelles waters. 
6. In the event of a technical problem or malfunction of the satellite monitoring device installed on board the fishing vessel, the master of that vessel shall communicate in good time by fax or e‐mail to the FMC of the flag State concerned the information specified in item 4. At least one Global Position Report every four hours shall be sufficient under such circumstances as long as the vessel stays in Seychelles waters. This Global Position Report will include the hourly positions as registered by the master of that vessel during those four hours. The FMC of the flag State or the vessel itself shall forward these messages to the Seychelles Monitoring Centre without delay. In case of necessity or doubts, the Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) could ask a specific vessel to transmit the Position Report on an hourly basis. Defective equipment shall be repaired or replaced as soon as the vessel concludes its fishing trip or within a month at most. After this period, a new fishing trip may not begin until the equipment has been repaired or replaced. 
7. The Vessel Monitoring System hardware and software components shall be temper proof, i.e. shall not permit the input or output of false positions and must not be capable of being manually over-ridden. The system shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of environmental conditions. It shall be prohibited to destroy, damage, render inoperative or otherwise interfere with the satellite tracking device. 
In particular, the master shall ensure that: 
- data are not altered in any way, 
- the antenna or the antennas connected to the satellite tracking devices are not obstructed in any way, and 
- the power supply of the satellite tracking devices is not interrupted in any way. 
Any breach of the abovementioned obligations may render the master liable under the laws and regulations of Seychelles, provided that the vessel is operating in Seychelles waters. 
8. The FMCs of the flag States shall monitor the tracking of their vessels when the latter are in Seychelles waters, at one-hour intervals. If the tracking of the vessels is not carried out under the conditions envisaged, the Seychelles Monitoring Centre shall be informed immediately and the procedure provided for in item 6 will be applicable. 
9. Relevant FMCs and the Seychelles Monitoring Centre shall cooperate to ensure the implementation of these provisions. If the Seychelles Monitoring Centre establishes that the flag State is not transmitting the data in conformity with item 4 above, the other party shall be notified immediately. Upon receipt of notification, the latter shall respond within 24 hours by informing the Seychelles Monitoring Centre of the reasons for non‐transmission and stating a reasonable deadline for complying with these provisions. In case of failure to comply within this deadline, the two parties will settle such problems in writing or as provided for by point 13 of these provisions. 
10. Monitoring data transmitted in accordance with these provisions shall be used exclusively for control, management, monitoring and enforcement by the Seychelles authorities of the Community fleet fishing under the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles. These data cannot be communicated to other parties under any circumstances, except with the written consent of the flag State concerned, on a case by case basis, or by an order of the Court in Seychelles. 
11. It is agreed that, at the request of either party, there will be an exchange of information on the equipment used for satellite tracking, in order to ensure that this equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other party for the purposes of these provisions. 
12. The Parties agree to review these provisions as and when appropriate, including all cases of malfunctioning or anomalies related to individual vessels. All such cases will have to be notified by the SFA to the EC flag Member States at least 15 days before the review meeting. 
13. Any dispute concerning the interpretation or the application of these provisions shall be subject to consultation between the Parties within the framework of the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles. 
14. These provisions shall enter into force on 18 January 2005.
