Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 November 2003 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices, amending Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Directive 71/127/EEC (Text with EEA relevance.) 
Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 10 November 2003 
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices, amending Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Directive 71/127/EEC 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 71/127/EEC of 1 March 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the rear-view mirrors of motor vehicles(4) was adopted as one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval procedure which was established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5). Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 71/127/EEC. 
(2) Existing provisions, in particular in the case of categories N2, N3, M2 and M3 have proved inadequate as regards the exterior field of vision to the side, front and rear of the vehicle. In order to remedy this shortcoming, it is necessary to require an extension of the field of vision. 
(3) In the light of the experience gained and the present state of the art, it is now possible to amplify certain requirements of Directive 71/127/EEC with a view to improving road safety and to permit the use of mirrors to be supplemented by other technologies. 
(4) Taking into account the nature and the number of changes necessary to the requirements in force today, it is advisable to repeal andreplace Directive 71/127/EEC by this Directive. Since the type-approval and the conformity of production procedures are provided for in Directive 70/156/EEC, it is not necessary to repeat them in this Directive. 
(5) The Annexes to Directive 70/156/EEC should be amended accordingly, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
The aim of this Directive is to harmonise rules relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices. 
These rules are contained in the Annexes to this Directive.

8. TYPE MODIFICATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO THE APPROVALS 
8.1. Where type modifications are made to the type of vehicle or type of device for indirect vision approved pursuant to this Directive, the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 70/156/EEC shall apply. 
9. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION (VEHICLES AND COMPONENTS) 
9.1. Measures to ensure conformity of production must be taken in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC. 
(1) A system for indirect vision is intended to detect relevant road users. The relevancy of a road user is defined by his or her position and (potential) speed. More or less in proportion with the speed of the pedestriancyclistmoped driver, the dimensions of these road users increase as well. For detection purposes a moped driver (D = 0,8) at 40 m distance would be equal to a pedestrian (D = 0,5) at a distance of 25 m. Considering the speeds, the moped driver would be selected as the criterion for the detection size; for that reason an object with a size of 0,8 m shall be used for determining the detection performance.

This derogation also applies to the attachments of mirrors (attachment plates, arms, swivel joints, etc.) which are situated less than 2 m from the ground and which do not project beyond the overall width of the vehicle, measured in the transverse plane passing through the lowest mirror attachments or any other point forward of this plane if this configuration produces a greater overall width. 
In such cases, a description specifying that the mirror must be mounted so as to conform to the abovementioned conditions for the positioning of its attachments on the vehicle must be provided. 
Where advantage is taken of this derogation, the arm shall be indelibly marked with the symbol 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002301.TIF%quot%%gt% 
and the type-approval certificate shall be endorsed to this effect. 
4.2. Impact test 
The test according to this paragraph is not to be carried out for devices integrated in the bodywork of the vehicle and providing a frontal deflecting area of an angle not more than 45 ° measured in relation to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle, or devices not protruding more than 100 mm measured beyond the circumscribing bodywork of the vehicle according to 74/483/EEC. 
4.2.1. Description of the test rig 
4.2.1.1. The test rig consists of a pendulum capable of swinging about two horizontal axes at right angles to each other, one of which is perpendicular to the plane containing the %quot%release%quot% trajectory of the pendulum. 
The end of the pendulum comprises a hammer formed by a rigid sphere with a diameter of 165 ± 1 mm having a 5 mm thick rubber covering of Shore A hardness 50. 
A device is provided which permits determination of the maximum angle assumed by the arm in the plane of release. 
A support firmly fixed to the structure of the pendulum serves to hold the specimens in compliance with the impact requirements specified in point 4.2.2.6. 
Figure 2 gives the dimensions of the test rig and the special design specifications: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002401.TIF%quot%%gt% 
4.2.1.2. The centre of percussion of the pendulum coincides with the centre of the sphere, which forms the hammer. It is at a distance %quot%l%quot% from the axis of oscillation in the release plane, which is equal to 1 m ± 5 mm. The reduced mass of the pendulum is mo= 6,8 ± 0,05 kilograms. The relationship of %quot%mo%quot% to the total mass %quot%m%quot% of the pendulum and to the distance %quot%d%quot% between the centre of gravity of the pendulum and its axis of rotation is expressed in the equation: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002402.TIF%quot%%gt% 
4.2.2. Description of the test 
4.2.2.1. The procedure used to clamp the mirror to the support shall be that recommended by the manufacturer of the device or, where appropriate, by the vehicle manufacturer. 
4.2.2.2. Positioning of the mirror for the test 
4.2.2.2.1. Mirrors shall be positioned on the pendulum impact rig in such a way that the axes which are horizontal and vertical when the mirror is installed on a vehicle in accordance with the applicant's mounting instructions are in a similar position. 
4.2.2.2.2. When a mirror is adjustable with respect to the base, the test position shall be that in which any pivoting device is least likely to operate, within the limits of adjustment provided by the applicant. 
4.2.2.2.3. When the mirror has a device for adjusting its distance from the base, the device must be set in the position in which the distance between the housing and the base is shortest. 
4.2.2.2.4. When the reflecting surface is mobile in the housing, it shall be so adjusted that the upper corner, which is furthest from the vehicle, is in the position of greatest projection relative to the housing. 
4.2.2.3. Except in the case of test 2 for interior mirrors (see point 4.2.2.6.1), when the pendulum is in a vertical position, the horizontal and longitudinal vertical planes passing through the centre of the hammer shall pass through the centre of the reflecting surface as defined in point 1.1.1.10 of Annex I. The longitudinal direction of oscillation of the pendulum shall be parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle. 
4.2.2.4. When, under the conditions governing adjustment laid down in points 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 parts of the mirror limit the return of the hammer, the point of impact must be displaced in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation or pivoting in question. 
The displacement must be no greater than is strictly necessary for the execution of the test; it must be limited in such a way that: 
- either the sphere delimiting the hammer remains at least tangential to the cylinder as defined in point 1.4; 
- or the point of contact with the hammer is located at least 10 mm from the periphery of the reflecting surface. 
4.2.2.5. The test consists in allowing the hammer to fall from a height corresponding to a pendulum angle of 60 ° from the vertical so that the hammer strikes the mirror at the moment when the pendulum reaches the vertical position. 
4.2.2.6. The mirrors are subjected to impact under the following different conditions: 
4.2.2.6.1. Interior mirrors 
- Test 1:The points of impact shall be as defined in point 4.2.2.3. The impact must be such that the hammer strikes the mirror on the reflecting surface side. 
- Test 2: Point of impact on the edge of the protective housing, such that the impact produced makes an angle of 45 ° with the plane of the reflecting surface and is situated in the horizontal plane passing through the centre of that surface. The impact must occur on the reflecting surface side. 
4.2.2.6.2. Exterior mirrors 
- Test 1: The point of impact shall be as defined in point 4.2.2.3 or 4.2.2.4. The impact must be such that the hammer strikes the mirror on the reflecting surface side. 
- Test 2: The point of impact shall be as defined in point 4.2.2.3 or 4.2.2.4. The impact must be such that the hammer strikes the mirror on the side opposite to the reflecting surface. 
Where Class II or III rear-view mirrors are fixed to the same mounting as Class IV rear-view mirrors, the abovementioned tests shall be executed on the lower mirror. Nevertheless, the technical service responsible for testing may repeat one or both of these tests on the upper mirror if this is less than 2 m from the ground. 
5. Results of the test 
5.1. In the tests described in point 4.2, the pendulum must continue to swing after impact in such a way that the projection of the position assumed by the arm on the plane of release makes an angle of at least 20 ° with the vertical. The accuracy of measurement of the angle shall be within ± 1 °. 
5.1.1. This requirement is not applicable to mirrors stuck to the windscreen, in respect of which the requirement stipulated in point 5.2 shall apply after the test. 
5.1.2. The required angle to the vertical is reduced from 20 ° to 10 ° for all Class II and Class IV rear-view mirrors and for Class III rear-view mirrors which are attached to the same mounting as Class IV mirrors. 
5.2. Should the mounting of the mirror break during the tests described in point 4.2 for mirrors stuck to the windscreen, the part remaining must not project beyond the base by more than 10 mm and the configuration remaining after the test must satisfy the conditions laid down in point 1.3. 
5.3. The reflecting surface must not break during the tests described in point 4.2. However breakage of the reflecting surface will be allowed if one of the following conditions is fulfilled: 
5.3.1. The fragments of glass still adhere to the back of the housing or to a surface firmly attached to the housing; partial separation of the glass from its backing is admissible provided this does not exceed 2,5 mm on either side of the cracks. It is permissible for small splinters to become detached from the surface of the glass at the point of impact; 
5.3.2. The reflecting surface is made of safety glass.

2.1. General requirements 
2.1.1. When the camera-monitor device for indirect vision is mounted on a plane surface, all parts, irrespective of the adjustment position of the device which are in potential, static contact with a sphere either 165 mm in diameter in the case of a monitor or 100 mm in diameter in the case of a camera, must have a radius of curvature %quot%c%quot% of not less than 2,5 mm. 
2.1.2. Edges of fixing holes or recesses of which the diameter or longest diagonal is less than 12 mm are exempt from the radius requirements of point 2.1.1 provided that they are blunted. 
2.1.3. For parts of the camera and the monitor which are made of a material with a Shore A hardness of less than 60 and which are mounted on a rigid support, the requirements of point 2.1.1 shall only apply to the support.

Appendix 1 
Procedure for determining the radius of curvature %quot%r%quot% of the reflecting surface of a mirror 
1. Measurement 
1.1. Equipment 
A %quot%spherometer%quot% similar to the one described in Figure 3 having the indicated distances between the tracing pin of the dial gauge and the fixed legs of the bar is used. 
1.2. Measuring points 
1.2.1. The principal radii of curvature shall be measured at three points situated as close as possible to positions at one-third, one-half and two-thirds of the distance along the arc of the reflecting surface passing through the centre of this surface and parallel to segment b, or of the arc passing through the centre of the reflecting surface which is perpendicular to it if this arc is the longer. 
1.2.2. Where, owing to the size of the reflecting surface, it is impossible to obtain measurements in the directions defined in point 1.1.1.5 of Annex I, the technical services responsible for the tests may take measurements at the said point in two perpendicular directions as close as possible to those prescribed above. 
2. Calculation of the radius of curvature %quot%r%quot% 
%quot%r%quot% expressed in mm is calculated from the formula: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002802.TIF%quot%%gt% 
where: 
rp1: the radius of curvature at the first measuring point,

(λ) (see table). 
1.4. CIE spectral tristimulus values(4): Tristimulus values of the spectral components of an equi-energy spectrum in the CIE (XYZ) system. 
1.5. Photopic vision(5): Vision by the normal eye when it is adapted to levels of luminance of at least several cd/m2. 
2. APPARATUS 
2.1. General 
The apparatus shall consist of a light source, a holder for the test sample, a receiver unit with a photodetector and an indicating meter (see Figure 4), and means of eliminating the effects of extraneous light. 
The receiver may incorporate a light-integrating sphere to facilitate measuring the reflectance of non-flat (convex) mirrors (see Figure 5). 
2.2. Spectral characteristics of light source and receiver 
The light source shall consist of a CIE standard source A and associated optics to provide a near-collimated light beam. A voltage stabiliser is recommended in order to maintain a fixed lamp voltage during instrument operation. 
The receiver shall have a photodetector with a spectral response proportional to the photopic luminosity function of the CIE (1931) standard colorimetric observer (see table). Any other combination of illuminate-filter-receptor giving the overall equivalent of CIE standard illuminate A and photopic vision may be used. When an integrating sphere is used in the receiver, the interior surface of the sphere shall be coated with a matt (diffusive) spectrally non-selective white coating. 
2.3. Geometrical conditions 
The angle of the incident beam (θ) should preferably be 0,44 ± 0,09 rad (25 ± 5 °) from the perpendicular to the test surface and shall not exceed the upper limit of the tolerance (i.e. 0,53 rad or 30 °). The axis of the receptor shall make an angle (θ) with this perpendicular equal to that of the incident beam (see Figure 4). The incident beam upon arrival at the test surface shall have a diameter of not less than 13 mm (0,5 in.). The reflected beam shall not be wider than the sensitive area of the photodetector, shall not cover less than 50 % of such area, and as nearly as possible shall cover the same area segment as used during instrument calibration. 
When an integrating sphere is used in the receiver section, the sphere shall have a minimum diameter of 127 mm (5 in.). The sample and incident beam apertures in the sphere wall shall be of such a size as to admit the entire incident and reflected light beams. The photodetector shall be so located as not to receive direct light from either the incident or the reflected beam. 
2.4. Electrical characteristics of the photodetector-indicator unit 
The photodetector output as read on the indicating meter shall be a linear function of the light intensity of the photosensitive area. Means (electrical and/or optical) shall be provided to facilitate zeroing and calibration adjustments. Such means shall not affect the linearity or the spectral characteristics of the instrument. The accuracy of the receptor-indicator unit shall be within ± 2 % of full scale, or ± 10 % of the magnitude of the reading, whichever is the smaller. 
2.5. Sample holder 
The mechanism shall be capable of locating the test sample so that the axes of the source arm and receptor intersect at the reflecting surface. The reflecting surface may lie within or at either face of the mirror sample, depending on whether it is a first-surface, second-surface or prismatic %quot%flip%quot%-type mirror. 
3. PROCEDURE 
3.1. Direct calibration method 
In the direct calibration method, air is used as the reference standard. This method is applicable for those instruments, which are so constructed as to permit calibration at the 100 % point by swinging the receiver to a position directly on the axis of the light source (see Figure 4). 
It may be desired in some cases (such as when measuring low-reflectivity surfaces) to use an intermediate calibration point (between 0 and 100 % on the scale) with this method. In these cases, a neutral density filter of known transmittance shall be inserted in the optical path, and the calibration control shall then be adjusted until the meter reads the percentage transmission of the neutral density filter. This filter shall be removed before reflectivity measurements are performed. 
3.2. Indirect calibration method 
The indirect calibration method is applicable in the case of instruments with fixed source and receiver geometry. A properly calibrated and maintained reflectance standard is required. This reference standard should preferably be a flat mirror with a reflectance value as near as possible to that of the test samples. 
3.3. Flat mirror measurement 
The reflectance of flat mirror samples can be measured on instruments employing either the direct or the indirect calibration method. The reflectance value is read directly from the indicating meter. 
3.4. Non-flat (convex) mirror measurement 
Measurement of the reflectance of non-flat (convex) mirrors requires the use of instruments which incorporate an integrating sphere in the receiver unit (see Figure 5). If the instrument-indicating meter indicates ne divisions with a standard mirror of E % reflectance, then, with a mirror of unknown reflectance, nx divisions will correspond to a reflectance of X %, in accordance with the formula:

1.1. Mirrors and other devices for indirect vision must be fitted in such a way that the mirror or other device does not move so as significantly to change the field of vision as measured or vibrate to an extent which would cause the driver to misinterpret the nature of the image perceived. 
1.2. The conditions laid down in item 1.1 must be maintained when the vehicle is moving at speeds of up to 80 % of its maximum design speed, but not exceeding 150 km/h. 
1.3. The fields of vision defined below shall be established using ambinocular vision, the eyes being at the %quot%driver's ocular points%quot% as defined in Annex I, point 1.1.1.12. The fields of vision shall be determined when the vehicle is in running order as defined in Directive 97/27/EC, Annex I, point 2.5. They shall be established through windows which have a total light transmission factor of at least 70 % measured normal to the surface. 
Mirrors 
2. Number 
2.1. Minimum number of compulsory mirrors 
2.1.1. The fields of vision prescribed in point 5 shall be obtained from the minimum number on mandatory mirrors set out in the following table. Where the presence of a mirror is not requested on a mandatory base, this means that no other system for indirect vision can be requested on a mandatory base. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
2.1.2. In case the described field of vision of a front mirror prescribed in point 5.6 can be obtained by another device for indirect vision that is approved according to Annex II, part B and that is installed according to this Annex, this device can be used instead of a mirror. 
In case a camera/monitor device is used the monitor must exclusively show the field of vision prescribed in point 5.6 while the vehicle is moving forward with a speed up to 30 km/h. In case the vehicle is moving with higher speed or moving backwards the monitor can be used to display the field of vision of other cameras mounted to the vehicle. 
2.2. The provisions of this Directive do not apply to the surveillance mirrors defined in point 1.1.1.3 of Annex I. Nevertheless, the exterior surveillance mirrors must be mounted at least 2 m above the ground when the vehicle is under a load corresponding to its maximum technical permissible mass. 
3. Position 
3.1. Mirrors must be so placed that the driver, when sitting on the driving seat in a normal driving position, has a clear view of the road to the rear, side(s) or front of the vehicle. 
3.2. Exterior mirrors shall be visible through the side windows or through the portion of the windscreen that is swept by the windscreen wiper. Nevertheless, for design reasons, this last provision (i.e. the provisions relating the cleaned part of the windscreen) shall not apply to: 
- exterior mirrors on the passenger side of vehicles of categories M2 and M3; 
- Class VI mirrors. 
3.3. In the case of any vehicle, which is in chassis/cab form when the field of vision is measured, the minimum and maximum body widths shall be stated by the manufacturer and, if necessary, simulated by dummy headboards. All vehicles and mirror configurations taken into consideration during the tests shall be shown on the EC type-approval certificate for a vehicle with regard to the installation of mirrors (see Appendix 4 to Annex I). 
3.4. The prescribed exterior mirror on the driver's side of the vehicle must be so located that an angle of not more than 55° is formed between the vertical longitudinal median plane of the vehicle and the vertical plane passing through the centre of the mirror and through the centre of the straight line 65 mm long which joins the driver's two ocular points. 
3.5. Mirrors must not project beyond the external bodywork of the vehicle substantially more than is necessary to comply with the requirements concerning fields of vision laid down in point 5. 
3.6. Where the lower edge of an exterior mirror is less than 2 m above the ground when the vehicle is loaded to its technically permissible maximum laden mass, this mirror must not project more than 250 mm beyond the overall width of the vehicle measured without mirrors. 
3.7. Class V and Class VI mirrors shall be mounted on vehicles in such a way that, regardless of their position after adjustment, no part of these mirrors or their holders is less than 2 m from the ground when the vehicle is under a load corresponding to its technically permissible maximum laden mass. 
These mirrors shall not, however, be mounted on vehicles the cab height of which is such as to prevent compliance with this requirement. In this case an other device for indirect vision is not required. 
3.8. Subject to the requirements of points 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7, mirrors may project beyond the permissible maximum widths of vehicles. 
4. Adjustment 
4.1. The interior mirror must be capable of being adjusted by the driver from his driving position. 
4.2. The exterior mirror situated on the driver's side must be capable of being adjusted from inside the vehicle while the door is closed, although the window may be open. The mirror may, however, be locked in position from the outside. 
4.3. The requirements of point 4.2 do not apply to exterior mirrors which, after having been knocked out of alignment, can be returned to their former position without the need for adjustment. 
5. Fields of vision 
5.1. Interior rear-view mirror (Class I) 
The field of vision must be such that the driver can see at least a 20 m wide, flat, horizontal portion of the road centred on the vertical longitudinal median plane of the vehicle and extending from 60 m behind the driver's ocular points (Figure 6) to the horizon.

%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.003901.TIF%quot%%gt% 
5.5. %quot%Close-proximity%quot% exterior mirror (Class V) 
The field of vision must be such that the driver can see a flat horizontal portion of the road along the side of the vehicle, bounded by the following vertical planes (see Figures 10a and 10b):

5.5.5. In case the field of vision described in Figures 10a and 10b can be perceived through the combination of the field of vision from a Class IV wide-angle mirror and that of a Class VI front mirror, the installation of a Class V close proximity mirror is not compulsory. 
Figures 10a and 10b: Field of vision of Class V close-proximity mirror 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.004001.TIF%quot%%gt% 
5.6. Front mirror (Class VI) 
5.6.1. The field of vision must be such that the driver can see at least a flat horizontal portion of the road, which is bounded by: 
- one traverse vertical plane through the outermost point of the front of the vehicle-cab 
- one traverse vertical plane 2000 mm in front of the vehicle 
- one longitudinal vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane going though the outermost side of the vehicle at the driver's side and 
- one longitudinal vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane 2000 mm outside the outermost side of the vehicle opposite to the driver's side. 
The front of this field of vision opposite to the driver's side may be rounded off with a radius of 2000 mm (see Figure 11). 
The provisions for front mirrors are compulsory for forward-controlled (as defined in Directive 70/156/EEC, Annex I(a), footnote (Z)) vehicles of categories N2 %amp%gt; 7,5 t and N3. 
If vehicles of these categories with other construction characteristics regarding the bodywork cannot fulfil the requirements by using a front mirror, a camera/monitor device shall be used. If either of these options do not provide the adequate field of vision then any other device for indirect vision shall be used. This device must be able to detect an object of 50 cm height and with a diameter of 30 cm within the field defined in Figure 11. 
Figure 11: Field of vision of Class VI front mirror 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.004101.TIF%quot%%gt% 
5.6.2. However, if the driver can see, taking into account the obstructions by the A-pillars, a straight line 300 mm in front of the vehicle at a height of 1200 mm above the road surface and which is situated between a longitudinal vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane going through the outermost side of the vehicle at the driver's side and a longitudinal vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane 900 mm outside the outermost side of the vehicle opposite to the driver's side, a front mirror of class VI is not mandatory. 
5.7. In the case of mirrors consisting of several reflecting surfaces which are either of a different curvature or make an angle with each other, at least one of the reflecting surfaces must provide the field of vision and have the dimensions (see point 2.2.2 of Annex II) specified for the class to which they belong. 
5.8. Obstructions 
5.8.1. Interior rear-view mirror (Class I) 
The field of vision may be reduced by the presence of headrest and devices such as, in particular, sun visors, rear windscreen wipers, heating elements and stop lamp of category S3 or by components of bodywork such as window columns of rear split doors, provided that all these devices together do not obscure more than 15 per cent of the prescribed field of vision when projected onto a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle. The degree of obstruction shall be measured with the headrests adjusted to their lowest possible position and with the sun visors folded back. 
5.8.2. Exterior mirrors (Classes II, III, IV, V and VI) 
In the fields of vision specified above, obstruction due to the bodywork and some of its components, such as other mirrors, door handles, outline marker lights, direction indicators and rear bumpers, as well as reflective-surface cleaning components, shall not be taken into account if they are responsible for a total obstruction of less than 10 % of the specified field of vision. 
5.9. Test procedure 
The field of vision shall be determined by placing powerful light sources at the ocular points and examining the light reflected on the vertical monitoring screen. Other equivalent methods may be used. 
Devices for indirect vision other than mirrors 
6. A device for indirect vision shall give such performances that a critical object can be observed within the described field of vision, taking into account the critical perception. 
7. Obstruction of the driver's direct view caused by the installation of a device for indirect vision shall be restricted to a minimum. 
8. For the determination of the detection distance in case of camera-monitor devices for indirect vision, the procedure of the Appendix to this Annex shall be applied. 
9. Installation requirements for the monitor 
The viewing direction of the monitor shall roughly be the same direction as the one for the main mirror. 
10. Vehicles of category M2 and M3 and complete or completed vehicles of categories N2 %amp%gt;7,5 t and N3 having a special bodywork for refuse collection may be equipped on the rear part of their bodywork with a device for indirect vision other than a mirror in order to ensure the following field of vision. 
10.1. The field of vision (see figure 12) must be such that the driver can see at least a flat horizontal portion of the road, which is bounded by: 
- a vertical plane aligned on the furthest rear point of the complete vehicle and perpendicular to the longitudinal vertical median plane of the vehicle; 
- a vertical plane which is parallel to and positioned 2000 mm to the rear of the previous plane (with respect to the rear of the vehicle); 
- two longitudinal vertical planes defined at the outermost sides of the vehicle and which are parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane of the vehicle. 
10.2. If vehicles of these categories cannot fulfil the requirements of point 10.1 by using a camera/monitor device, other devices for indirect vision can be used. In this case the device must be able to detect an object of 50 cm height and with a diameter of 30 cm within the field defined in point 10.1.

Calculation of the detection distance 
1. CAMERA MONITOR DEVICE FOR INDIRECT VISION 
1.1. Resolution threshold of a camera 
The resolution threshold of a camera is defined by the formula: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.004302.TIF%quot%%gt% 
where: 
ωc: resolution threshold of the camera (arc-min) 
βc: angle of vision of the camera (°) 
Nc: number of video lines of the camera 
The manufacturer shall supply the values for βc and Nc. 
1.2. Determination of the critical viewing distance of the monitor 
For a monitor having certain dimensions and properties, a distance to the monitor can be calculated within which the detection distance is dependent only on the performances of the camera. This critical viewing distance rm,c is defined by: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.004303.TIF%quot%%gt% 
where: 
rm,c: critical viewing distance (m) 
Hm: height of the monitor image (m) 
Nm: number of video lines of the monitor (-) 
ωeye: resolution threshold of the observer (minutes of arch) 
The number 60 is for conversion from minutes of arches to degrees. 
The manufacturer shall supply the values for Hm and Nm. 
ωeye = 1 
1.3. Determination of the detection distance 
1.3.1. Maximum detection distance within the critical viewing distance where, due to the installation, the distance eye-monitor is less than the critical viewing distance, the maximum attainable detection distance shall be defined by: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.004401.TIF%quot%%gt% 
where: 
rd: detection distance [m] 
Do: diameter of the object [m] 
f: threshold increasing factor 
ωc, βc and Nc according to item 1.1 
D0= 0,8 m 
f = 8 
1.3.2. Detection distance greater than the critical viewing distance. Where, due to the installation, the distance eye-monitor is more than the critical viewing distance, the maximum obtainable detection distance shall be defined: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.004402.TIF%quot%%gt% 
where: 
rm: viewing distance to the monitor (m) 
Dm: diagonal of the monitor screen (inch) 
Nm: number of video lines of the monitor (-) 
βc and Nc according to point 1.1 
Nm and ωeye according to point 1.2 
2. SECONDARY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
Based on the installation conditions, a determination shall be made to discover whether the entire device can still satisfy the functional requirements listed in Annex II, especially the glare correction, the maximum and the minimum luminance of the monitor. It shall also be determined the degree to which the glare correction will be addressed and the angle at which sunlight can strike a monitor and these shall be compared to the corresponding measuring results from the system measurements. 
This can be based on either a CAD-generated model, a determination of the angles of light for the device when mounted on the relevant vehicle, or by carrying out relevant measurements on the relevant vehicle as described in Annex II, part B, point 3.2.
