COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1868/77 of 29 July 1977 laying down detailed rules of application for Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in eggs (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 368/76 (2), and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 369/76 (4), and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 of 29 October 1975 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks (5), and in particular Article 17 thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 laid down certain rules for the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks ; whereas, the implementation of these rules requires rules of application regarding the allocation of distinguishing numbers, the markings to be made on eggs and packaging and the communication of the necessary information; 
Whereas each establishment must be given a distinguishing registration number based on a code so drawn up in each Member State that it is possible to determine the activity in which the establishment is engaged; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 95/69 of 17 January 1969 implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1619/68 on marketing standards for eggs (6), as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2772/75 of 29 October 1975 on marketing standards for eggs (7) provides for the identification and marketing of incubated eggs which were not marketed before being put into incubation and are marketed as industrial eggs; 
Whereas statistics on which short-term and long-term forecasts are based must be comparable ; whereas the monthly summaries prepared by Member States should therefore be harmonized ; whereas, moreover, the collection of information could be facilitated by using a standard form for the summary; 
Whereas the present information on intra-Community trade in chicks is not sufficient to establish short-term production estimates ; whereas special arrangements should be made for Member States that do not have the necessary administrative machinery for collecting such information; 
Whereas it is for each Member State to lay down the penalties for infringements of these provisions; 
Whereas, to simplify the rules, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2335/72 of 31 October 1972 implementing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1349/72 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 373/73 (9), should be repealed; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs, (1)OJ No L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 49. (2)OJ No L 45, 21.2.1976, p. 2. (3)OJ No L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 77. (4)OJ No L 45, 21.2.1976, p. 3. (5)OJ No L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 100. (6)OJ No L 13, 18.1.1969, p. 13. (7)OJ No L 282, 1.11.1975, p. 56. (8)OJ No L 252, 8.11.1972, p. 1. (9)OJ No L 39, 12.2.1973, p. 37.
