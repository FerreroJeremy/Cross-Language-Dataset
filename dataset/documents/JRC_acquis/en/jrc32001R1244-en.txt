Council Regulation (EC) No 1244/2001 
of 19 June 2001 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Whereas: 
(1) For direct payments under the various income support schemes in the common agricultural policy, statistics show that a high number of farmers receive very small amounts. The aid schemes make no distinction between farmers receiving small amounts and those receiving larger amounts, the eligibility conditions and administrative and control provisions being the same. 
(2) Setting up a simplified aid scheme for farmers receiving small amounts can contribute to reducing the administrative burden at the level of farmers, national administrations and the Commission. It is appropriate to test the efficiency of such a scheme for a trial period. Farmers entitled to small amounts or willing to accept a smaller amount of aid should receive, during a minimum period, one global payment per year, under simplified conditions. Due to its temporary nature, participation in the scheme should be on a voluntary basis both for Member States and farmers in the Member States that decide to apply the scheme. 
(3) In order to simplify administrative procedures, Member States should be allowed to make single combined payments to participating farmers, covering the aids granted under this simplified scheme and those granted under other support schemes. 
(4) Without prejudice to the existing common rules for direct support schemes established by Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999(3), taking into account that the scheme is on a trial basis, it is appropriate to provide the Commission with the necessary flexibility to implement the scheme. To achieve the aim of simplification, it may moreover be necessary to derogate, in certain well defined and justified cases, from the existing rules provided for in the relevant Regulations concerning the support aids as well as Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(4). 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 establishes common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy. It is therefore appropriate to amend it to include this simplified scheme. 
(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

Farmers receiving early retirement aid under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 may not participate in the scheme. 
3. The amount which a farmer may receive under the scheme shall be the highest of: 
(a) the average of the amounts granted under the relevant regulations during the three calendar years preceding the year of application, 
(b) the total amount granted under the relevant regulations in the calendar year preceding the year of application. 
Area aids for flax and hemp, provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70(11) shall be included in the calculation. 
In case of application of Article 4 of this Regulation during the reference periods referred to in points (a) and (b), the amounts referred to in the said points (a) and (b) shall be calculated as the amounts that would have been granted before application of Article 4. 
4. The amount referred to in paragraph 3 shall be no more than EUR 1250. 
However, applicants who would be entitled to receive higher amounts under the relevant regulations may choose to enter the simplified scheme if they agree to receive no more than the maximum amount without prejudice to paragraph 5. 
Aid under the simplified scheme shall be paid once a year, starting from the year in which application for participation in the scheme is made, until 2005. 
5. Member States may decide to apply Article 4 to the simplified scheme. 
6. Applicants will undertake to maintain the land in good agricultural condition. They may use the land for any agricultural purpose except for the production of hemp falling within CN Code 5302 10 00. 
Member States shall define good agricultural conditions taking into account notably, the measures they have taken in the application of this Regulation and Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999(12). 
7. Member States may decide to implement the simplified scheme at national or regional level and to combine the date of payments under the Simplified Scheme with the date of payment under any other support scheme.%quot%; 
2. Article 11 shall be replaced by the following: %quot%Article 11
