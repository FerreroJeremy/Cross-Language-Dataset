Council Directive 2005/24/EC 
of 14 March 2005 
with regard to the use of ova and embryos and storage centres for semen from pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament [1], 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 4 of Council Directive 87/328/EEC of 18 June 1987 on the acceptance for breeding purposes of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species [3] requires semen for intra-Community trade to be collected, treated and stored in an officially approved artificial insemination centre. 
(2) Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in, and imports of, semen of domestic animals of the bovine species [4] allows semen to be stored not only in semen collection centres but also in semen storage centres. 
(3) In order to ensure consistency in Community legislation, Article 4 of Directive 87/328/EEC should be adapted to the extended scope of, and the newly introduced definitions in, Directive 88/407/EEC. On that occasion, Directive 87/328/EEC should be aligned on the other legislation on pure-breeding animals with regard to ova and embyros,
