RECOGNIZING the prime responsibilities of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties for the protection and preservation of the Antarctic environment and, in particular, their responsibilities under Article IX, paragraph 1 (f) of the Antarctic Treaty in respect of the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica; 
RECALLING the action already taken by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties including, in particular, the agreed measures for the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora, as well as the provisions of the Convention for the conservation of Antarctic seals; 
BEARING in mind the concern regarding the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources expressed by the consultative parties at the ninth consultative meeting of the Antarctic Treaty and the importance of the provisions of recommendation IX-2 which led to the establishment of the present Convention; 
BELIEVING that it is in the interest of all mankind to preserve the waters surrounding the Antarctic continent for peaceful purposes only and to prevent their becoming the scene or object of international discord;

The Party commencing proceedings shall communicate the name of an arbitrator to the other Party which, in turn, within a period of 40 days following such notification, shall communicate the name of the second arbitrator. The Parties shall, within a period of 60 days following the appointment of the second arbitrator, appoint the third arbitrator, who shall not be a national of either Party and shall not be of the same nationality as either of the first two arbitrators. The third arbitrator shall preside over the tribunal. 
If the second arbitrator has not been appointed within the prescribed period, or if the Parties have not reached agreement within the prescribed period on the appointment of the third arbitrator, that arbitrator shall be appointed, at the request of either Party, by the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, from among persons of international standing not having the nationality of a State which is a Party to this Convention. 
The arbitral tribunal shall decide where its headquarters will be located and shall adopt its own rules of procedure. 
The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be made by a majority of its members, who may not abstain from voting. 
Any Contracting Party which is not a Party to the dispute may intervene in the proceedings with the consent of the arbitral tribunal. 
The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on all Parties to the dispute and on any Party which intervenes in the proceedings and shall be complied with without delay. The arbitral tribunal shall interpret the award at the request of one of the Parties to the dispute or of any intervening Party. 
Unless the arbitral tribunal determines otherwise because of the particular circumstances of the case, the expenses of the tribunal, including the remuneration of its members, shall be borne by the Parties to the dispute in equal shares.
