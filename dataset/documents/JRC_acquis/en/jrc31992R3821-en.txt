Whereas Article 34 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1780/89 of 21 June 1989 laying down detailed rules for the disposal of alcohol obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 35, 36 and 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and held by intervention agencies (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2864/92 (9), provides for the representative market rate to be used to convert the payments, guarantees and securities concerned; 
Whereas Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2053/89 (10) and (EEC) No 2054/89 (11) laying down detailed rules for the application of the minimum import price system for certain processed cherries and for dried grapes respectively, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3390/89 (12), provides for the use of the representative market rate to convert the minimum import price into national currency; 
Whereas the second paragraph of Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 209/88 of 26 January 1988 on the fixing of additional amounts for imports of pigmeat products from third countries (13), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3117/89 (14), provides that the offer price is expressed in ecus after conversion of the prices recorded in national currency into ecus using the representative market rate; 
Whereas Article 1 (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 163/67/EEC of 26 June 1967 on fixing the additional amont for imports of poultry-farming products from third countries (15), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3116/89 (16), provides that the offer price is expressed in ecus after conversion of the prices recorded in national currency into ecus using the representative market rate;
