Commission notice concerning the date of application of the protocols on rules of origin providing for diagonal cumulation between the Community, Algeria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Norway, Romania, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and West Bank and Gaza Strip 
Commission notice concerning the date of application of the protocols on rules of origin providing for diagonal cumulation between the Community, Algeria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Norway, Romania, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and West Bank and Gaza Strip 
(2006/C 187/04) 
For the purpose of the creation of diagonal cumulation of origin among the Community, Algeria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Norway, Romania, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Community and the countries concerned notify each other, through the European Commission, of the origin rules in force with the other countries. 
Based on the notifications received from the countries concerned, the table here enclosed gives an overview of the protocols on rules of origin providing for diagonal cumulation specifying the date from which such cumulation becomes applicable. This table replaces the previous one (OJ C 166, 18.7.2006). 
It is recalled that cumulation can be only applied if the countries of final manufacture and of final destination have concluded free trade agreements, containing identical rules of origin, with all the countries participating in the acquisition of originating status, i.e. with all the countries from which all the materials used originate. Materials originating in the country which has not concluded an agreement with the countries of final manufacture and of final destination shall be treated as non-originating. Specific examples are given in the Explanatory Notes concerning the pan-Euro-Mediterranean protocols on rules of origin [1]. 
It is also recalled that: 
- Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein form a customs union; 
- within the European Economic Area, which is composed of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the date of application is 1 November 2005. 
The ISO-Alpha-2 codes for the country listed in the table are given here below.
