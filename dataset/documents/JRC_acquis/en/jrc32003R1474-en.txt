THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 453/2002(2), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 establishes the criteria for setting the aid for the cultivation of grapes intended for the production of dried grapes of the sultana and Muscatel varieties and currants. 
(2) The third subparagraph of Article 7(1) of that Regulation states that the amount of aid may be differentiated according to grape variety. It also states that that amount may also be differentiated according to other factors which may affect yields. In the case of sultanas an additional differentiation should therefore be provided for, between areas affected by phylloxera and other areas. 
(3) For the 2002/03 marketing year, verification of the areas used to grow the grapes referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 7(1) Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 has revealed no overrun of the maximum guaranteed area laid down in Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1621/1999 of 22 July 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the aid for the cultivation of grapes to produce certain varieties of dried grapes(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1880/2001(4). 
(4) The aid for the cultivation of those grapes should be determined for the 2003/04 marketing year. 
(5) The aid to be granted to producers replanting their vineyards in order to combat phylloxera under the conditions provided for in Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 should also be determined. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,
