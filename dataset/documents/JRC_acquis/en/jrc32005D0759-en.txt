Commission Decision 
of 27 October 2005 
concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries and the movement from third countries of birds accompanying their owners 
(notified under document number C(2005) 4287) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/759/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) 998/2003 of 26 May 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live birds other than poultry, including birds accompanying their owners (pet birds). 
(2) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC of 16 October 2000 laying down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certification for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine [2] provides that Member States are to authorise the import of birds from the third countries listed as members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The countries listed in the Annex to the present Decision are members of the OIE and accordingly Member States are required to accept imports of birds, other than poultry, from those countries under Decision 2000/666/EC. 
(3) Where necessary, reference should also be made to Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat [3]. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC provides for different veterinary control regimes depending on the number of animals. It is appropriate to use those differentiations in number for the sake of this Decision. 
(5) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC [4] requires imported animals to undergo the checks in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC. 
(6) In accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 the safeguard measures taken in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [5], and in particular Article 18 (1) thereof, shall apply. 
(7) Highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in imported birds in quarantine in a Member State, it appears therefore appropriate to suspend movement of pet birds from certain areas at risk and to use for the definition of the areas a reference to the relevant Regional Commissions of the OIE. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1

(b) are subjected to a 30 days post-import quarantine in the Member State of destination on premises approved in accordance with Article 3 (4) of Decision 2000/666/EC, or 
(c) have been vaccinated and at least on one occasion re-vaccinated within the last 6 months and not later than 60 days prior to dispatch, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions against avian influenza using an H5 vaccine approved for the species concerned, or 
(d) have been isolated for at least 10 days prior to export and have been subjected to a test for the detection of H5N1antigen or genome, as prescribed in Chapter 2.1.14 of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals carried out on a sample taken not earlier than on the third day of isolation. 
3. Compliance with the conditions in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be certified by an official veterinarian, in the case of the conditions in 2 (b) based on owners’ declaration, in the third country of dispatch in accordance with the model certificate provided for in Annex II.

(a) a declaration of the owner or the representative of the owner in accordance with Annex III,

Article 2 
Veterinary checks

Article 3 
This Decision shall not apply to the movement onto Community territory of birds accompanying their owners from Andorra, Faeroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino or Switzerland. 
Article 4
