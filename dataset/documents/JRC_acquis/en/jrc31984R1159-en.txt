COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1159/84 
of 27 April 1984 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 315/68 as regards the quality standards for bulbs of certain varieties of irises and tulips 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 234/68 of 27 February 1968 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in live trees and other plants, bulbs, roots and the like, cut flowers and ornamental foliage (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/68 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3718/81 (3), fixed the quality standards for flowering bulbs, corms and tubers; 
Whereas the creation of new varieties and sports of 'Wedgwood' and 'Prof. Blaauw' irises makes it necessary to adapt the botanical descriptions of these products; 
Whereas past experience shows that the minimum size 'grading 8' laid down for the bulbs of tulipa kaufmanniana, varieties 'Bellini', 'Edwin Fischer', 'Fair Lady', 'Fritz Kreisler', 'Gaiety', 'Golden Sun', 'Goudstuk', 'Lady Rose', 'Mendelssohn', 'Robert Schumann', 'Solanus', 'Stresa' and 'Sweelinck' does not ensure satisfactory flowering; whereas these standards should therefore be adjusted accordingly; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the advice of the Management Committee for Live Trees and Other Plants, Bulbs, Roots and the Like, Cut Flowers and Ornamental Foliage, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
