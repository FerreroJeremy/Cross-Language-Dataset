THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 64/432/EEC on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine(1), as last amended by Directive 2000/20/EC(2), and in particular Annex AI(4) thereto, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 1999/467/EC of 15 July 1999 establishing the officially tuberculosis-free status of bovine herds of certain Member States or regions of Member States and repealing Decision 97/76/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2000/694/EC(4), granted this status to certain Member States and regions thereof. 
(2) The competent authorities of France submitted to the Commission documentation demonstrating compliance with all of the conditions provided for in Annex A(I)(4) to Directive 64/432/EEC, and in particular that, calculated at 31 December of each year, more than 99,9 % of the bovine herds in France have been officially free from bovine tuberculosis for the past six consecutive years and that recording in a database established in December 1999 allows tracing of bovine animals which are identified in accordance with Community legislation. 
(3) It appears therefore appropriate to declare France officially tuberculosis-free in accordance with the provisions of the above Directive. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
