THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 of 4 November 1991 prohibiting the use of leghold traps in the Community and the introduction into the Community of pelts and manufactured goods of certain wild animals species originating in countries which catch them by means of leghold traps or trapping methods which do not meet international humane trapping standards (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 35/97 of 10 January 1997 laying down provisions on the certification of pelts and goods covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 (2), and in particular Article 1(1)(a) thereof, is applicable only with respect to the importation of pelts of animals not born and bred in captivity from countries appearing on the list referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91; 
Whereas the list established by Council Decision 97/602/EC (3), as amended by Commission Decision 98/188/EC (4), can only be of a transitional nature; whereas it should be amended immediately as the situation evolves, in particular in circumstances covered by Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91, so as not to hinder trade in furs and fur-related products; 
Whereas information the Commission has received from the Republic of Croatia indicates that that country prohibits the use of leghold traps;
