THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Whereas:

Pursuant to Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse)(3), the European Securities Committee may act as regulatory committee within the meaning of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4). 
(3) In its Resolutions of 5 February 2002 and 21 November 2002, the European Parliament endorsed the four-level regulatory framework advocated in the Final Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of European securities markets and called for certain aspects of that approach to be extended to the banking and insurance sectors, subject to a clear Council commitment to guarantee a proper institutional balance. 
(4) On 3 December 2002, the Council invited the Commission to take steps in order to transfer to the structures already established in the securities field the present functions and powers held by the UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) Contact Committee, set up by Council Directive 85/611/EEC of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)(5), as last amended by Directive 2001/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6). 
(5) The Commission has proposed a directive of the Council and the European Parliament, amending, inter alia, Directive 85/611/EEC to delete the functions of the UCITS Contact Committee under Article 53 of that Directive and to transfer those laid down under Article 53a of the same Directive to the European Securities Committee. 
(6) Such an amendment will require a corresponding and simultaneous amendment of the competences of the European Securities Committee, as defined in Article 2 of Decision 2001/528/EC, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
