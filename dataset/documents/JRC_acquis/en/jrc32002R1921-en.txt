THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2535/95(2), and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1098/2001(4), provides that implementation of the annual plan for the distribution of the food products to the most deprived persons shall run from 1 October to 30 September of the following year. For the sake of the sound management of intervention stocks, provision should be made to ensure that the products to be distributed are withdrawn from intervention stocks by 31 August of the year of distribution at the latest. 
(2) Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 sets the accounting value of the products made available. This provision should be adapted to take account of changes in the intervention scheme affecting the common organisation of the market in beef and veal. 
(3) Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 should be repealed, since it no longer applies as the transport costs concerned are reimbursed on the basis of expenditure incurred. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Management Committees concerned,
