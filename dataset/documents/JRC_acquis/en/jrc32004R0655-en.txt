(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

After consulting the Scientific Committee on Food, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001(2) sets maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs, including foods intended for infants and young children covered by Commission Directive 96/5/EC of 16 February 1996 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children(3). 
(2) According to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 specific maximum levels of contaminants for food intended for infants and young children should be established by 5 April 2004. 
(3) Maximum levels for nitrate are set for certain vegetables in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 563/2002(4) in response to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food of 1995. In order to protect public health, in particular in view of the possible association with the formation of carcinogenic substances such as nitrosamines, the level of nitrate should be reduced to as low as reasonably achievable 
(4) It is appropriate for the health protection of infants and young children, a vulnerable population group, to establish a low maximum level, which is achievable through a strict selection of the raw materials used for the manufacturing of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods.

The provisions of the Directive are appropriate for sampling for official control of nitrate. 
(6) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should be amended accordingly. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
