Whereas: 
(1) Article 63 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2409/2000(3), lays down rules for applying distillation as provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, and paragraph 4 of that Article sets the dates for the twice-monthly notification by the Member States of conctracts concluded for such distillation. To take account of the holidays around Christmas in certain Member States, the date of the first notification in January should be put back. 
(2) The first subparagraph of Article 100(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 sets certain ceilings on alcohol losses admissible in products distilled from wine during the various stages of storage and transport. The second and third subparagraphs of that paragraph lay down rules on the combined application of those limits. Those rules are wrong and they should be corrected. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
