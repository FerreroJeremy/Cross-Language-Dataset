amending Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 on statistical information relating to the payment of export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2580/2000(2), and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In light of the evolution of information technology systems and the ongoing requirement of the Commission to have at its disposal improved statistical information, it is appropriate to adapt the format and scope of the statistical information communicated to the Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 of 25 November 1993 on statistical information relating to the payment of export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1432/96(4). 
(2) Having regard to the improvement of information technology it is no longer useful to manipulate statistical information in groups of products. The communication of that information in groups of products should therefore no longer be required. 
(3) Article 17(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2002(6), has expanded the range of goods and lowered the threshold for declaring whether these goods contain a high percentage of certain milk products. Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 should be adapted to reflect this change. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on Horizontal Questions relating to trade in Processed Agricultural Products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,
