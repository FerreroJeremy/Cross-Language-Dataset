Referring court 
Tribunal de commerce de Charleroi 
Parties to the main proceedings 
Applicants: SA Sporting du Pays de Charleroi, G-14 Groupment des clubs de football européens 
Defendant: Fédération internationale de football association (FIFA) 
Question referred 
Do the obligations on clubs and football players having employment contracts with those clubs imposed by the provisions of FIFA's statutes and regulations providing for the obligatory release of players to national federations without compensation and the unilateral and binding determination of the coordinated international match calendar constitute unlawful restrictions of competition or abuses of a dominant position or obstacles to the exercise of the fundamental freedoms conferred by the EC Treaty and are they therefore contrary to Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty or to any other provision of Community law, particularly Articles 39 and 49 of the Treaty?
