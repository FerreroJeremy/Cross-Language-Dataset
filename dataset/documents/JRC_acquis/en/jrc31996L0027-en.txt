Directive 96/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 1996 on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a side impact and amending Directive 70/156/EEC 
DIRECTIVE 96/27/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 May 1996 on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a side impact and amending Directive 70/156/EEC 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), and in particular Article 13 (4) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Acting in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (4), 
Whereas the total harmonization of technical requirements for motor vehicles is necessary in order fully to achieve the internal market; 
Whereas in order to reduce the number of road accident casualties in Europe, it is necessary to introduce legislative measures for improving the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a side impact as much as possible; whereas this Directive introduces side impact test requirements, including biomechanical criteria, to ensure that a reasonable level of side impact resistance is provided; 
Whereas these requirements should be regarded as an interim measure and will need to be reviewed in the light of further research and experience gained during the first two years of type-approval tests carried out in accordance with this Directive; whereas the establishment of more stringent standards will ensure a higher level of safety in future; 
Whereas this Directive will be one of the separate directives which must be complied with in order to ensure the conformity of vehicles with the requirements of the EC type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, therefore, the provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive; 
Whereas the procedure for determining the seating reference point in motor vehicles is given in Annex III to Council Directive 77/649/EEC of 27 September 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the field of vision of motor vehicle drivers (5); whereas it is therefore unnecessary to repeat it in this Directive; whereas reference should be made in this Directive to Council Directive 70/387/EEC of 27 July 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the doors of motor vehicles and their trailers (6), Council Directive 74/483/EEC of 17 September 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the external projections of motor vehicles (7), Council Directive 76/115/EEC of 18 December 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to anchorages for motor-vehicle safety belts (8) and to ISO standard 6487:1987; 
Whereas the technical requirements of this Directive are based on United Nations Economic Commission for Europe document TRANS/SC1/WP29/396, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
For the purposes of this Directive, 'vehicle` shall have the meaning given to it in Article 2 of Directive 70/156/EEC. 
Article 2 
1. No Member State may, on grounds concerning the protection of occupants of vehicles in the event of a side impact resistance: 
- refuse, in respect of a vehicle type, to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval, or 
- prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of a vehicle, 
if it complies with the requirements of this Directive. 
2. With effect from 1 October 1998, Member States may no longer grant: 
- EC type-approval for a vehicle type in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/156/EEC, 
- national type-approval for a vehicle type, 
unless the vehicle satisfies the requirements of this Directive. 
3. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to types of vehicle which have been type-approved before 1 October 1998 in application of any two of the following Directives: 70/387/EEC (door latches and hinges), 74/483/EEC (external projections) and 76/115/EEC (anchorages for motor-vehicle safety belts) nor, where appropriate, to subsequent extensions to those type-approvals. 
4. With effect from 1 October 2003, Member States must consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles in accordance with Directive 70/156/EEC to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7 (1) of that Directive, if they do not certify that the vehicles conform to the requirements of the Annexes to this Directive. 
Article 3 
In Part 1 of Annex IV to Directive 70/156/EEC the table shall be supplemented as follows: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Article 4 
In the framework of the adaptation of this Directive to technical progress within two years from the date mentioned in Article 2 (2), a review shall be held by the Commission. It shall be based on a review of the technical criteria and, in particular, the viscous criterion, front seat position and the ground clearance of the barrier. The review criteria will include inter alia accident research data, full scale car-to-car test results and cost-benefit considerations. The review will examine the potential gains in passenger protection and the industrial feasibility of increasing the ground clearance of the barrier. The results of this review will be subject to a report from the Commission to the European Parliament and Council.

ANNEX I 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS FOR THE TYPE-APPROVAL OF A VEHICLE TYPE 
1. APPLICATION FOR EC TYPE-APPROVAL 
1.1. Pursuant to Article 3 (4) of Directive 70/156/EEC applications for EC type-approval of a vehicle type with regard to the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a side-impact protection must be submitted by the manufacturer. 
1.2. A model for the information document is given in Appendix 1. 
1.3. A vehicle representative of the vehicle type to be approved must be submitted to the technical service responsible for conducting the type-approval tests. 
1.4. The manufacturer is entitled to submit any data and test results as evidence that compliance with the requirements can be achieved with a sufficient degree of confidence. 
2. EC TYPE-APPROVAL 
2.1. EC type-approval is granted in accordance with Article 4 (3) and, if applicable, 4 (4) of Directive 70/156/EEC where the vehicle type satisfies the relevant requirements. 
2.2. A model for the EC type-approval certificate is given in Appendix 2. 
2.3. A type-approval number in accordance with Annex VII to Directive 70/156/EEC is assigned to each vehicle type approved. The same Member State must not assign the same number to another type of vehicle. 
2.4. In doubtful cases, in order to verify that the vehicle conforms to the requirements of this Directive, account must be taken of any data or test results provided by the manufacturer which may be of use in establishing the validity of the type-approval test performed by the type approval authority. 
3. MODIFICATION OF THE TYPE AND AMENDMENTS TO TYPE-APPROVALS 
3.1. In the case of amendments to type-approvals granted pursuant to this Directive, the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 70/156/EEC are applicable. 
3.2. Any modification of the vehicle affecting the general form of the structure of the vehicle, or any variation in the reference mass greater than 8 % which in the judgment of the authority would have a marked influence on the results of the test necessitates a repetition of the test as described in Appendix 1 of Annex II. 
3.3. If the technical service, after consulting the vehicle manufacturer, considers that modifications to a vehicle type are insufficient to warrant a complete retest then a partial test may be used. This would be the case if the reference mass differs by no more than 8 % from the original vehicle, or the number of front seats is unchanged. Variations of seat-type or interior fittings do not automatically entail a full retest. An example of how to approach this problem is given in Appendix 5 of Annex II. 
4. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION 
4.1. As a general rule, measures to ensure the conformity of production must be taken in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC.

2.15. 'Multi-stage build` means the procedure whereby two or more manufacturers separately and sequentially participate in the construction of a vehicle. 
3. SPECIFICATIONS AND TESTS 
3.1. The vehicle must undergo a test in accordance with Appendix 1 to this Annex. 
3.1.1. The test is carried out on the driver's side unless asymmetric side structures, if any, are so different as to affect the performance in a side impact. In that case either of the alternatives in 3.1.1.1 or 3.1.1.2 may be used by agreement between the manufacturer and the service responsible for the tests. 
3.1.1.1. The manufacturer must provide the type-approval authority with information regarding the compatibility of performances in comparison with the driver's side where the test is being carried out on that side. 
3.1.1.2. The type-approval authority, after ascertaining the characteristics of the construction of the vehicle, may decide to have the test performed on the side opposite the driver, which is regarded as the less favourable option. 
3.1.2. The test authority, after consulting the manufacturer, may require the test to be carried out with the seat in a position other than the one indicated in Section 5.5.1 of Appendix 1 (1). That position will be specified in the test report. 
3.1.3. The result of this test is considered satisfactory if the conditions set out in 3.2 and 3.3 are satisfied. 
3.2. Performance criteria 
3.2.1. The performance criteria, as determined for the impact test in accordance with the Addendum to Appendix 1 to this Annex must meet the following conditions: 
3.2.1.1. the head performance criterion (HPC) must be no more than 1 000; if there is no head contact, the HPC is not measured or calculated but recorded as 'No head contact`. 
3.2.1.2. The thorax performance criteria must be: 
(a) rib deflection criterion (RDC) no more than 42 mm; 
(b) soft tissue criterion (V*C) no more than 1,0 m/s. 
For a transitional period of two years after the date shown in Article 2 (2) of this Directive the V*C value is not a pass/fail criterion for the type-approval tests, but this value has to be recorded in the test report and to be collected by the type-approval authorities. After this transitional period, the V*C value of 1,0 m/s applies as a pass/fail criterion unless, or until an alternative value is approved by the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress. 
3.2.1.3. The pelvis performance criterion must be: 
pubic symphysis peak force (PSPF) no more than 6 kN. 
3.2.1.4. The abdomen performance criterion must be: 
abdominal peak force (APF) no more than 2,5 kN internal force (equivalent to external force of 4,5 kN). 
3.3. Particular requirements 
3.3.1. No door must open during the test. 
3.3.2. After the impact, it must be possible without the use of tools: 
3.3.2.1. to open a sufficient number of doors provided for normal entry and exit of passengers, and if necessary tilt the seat-backs or seats to allow evacuation of all occupants; 
3.3.2.2. to release the dummy from the protective system; 
3.3.2.3. to remove the dummy from the vehicle. 
3.3.3. No interior device or component must become detached in such a way as to increase considerably the risk of injury from sharp projections or jagged edges. 
3.3.4. Ruptures resulting from permanent deformation are acceptable; provided these do not increase the risk of injury. 
3.3.5. If there is continuous leakage of liquid from the fuel-feed installation after the collision, the rate of leakage must not exceed 5 × 104 kg/s; if the liquid from the fuel-feed system mixes with liquids from the other systems and the various liquids cannot easily be separated and identified, all the liquids collected must be taken into account in evaluating the continuous leakage. 
(1) Until 30 September 2000, for the purposes of the test requirements, the range of normal longitudinal adjustments must be limited such that the H-point lies within the length of the door aperture. 
Appendix 1 
IMPACT TEST PROCEDURE 
1. INSTALLATIONS 
1.1. Testing ground 
The test area must be large enough to accommodate the mobile deformable barrier propulsion system and to permit after-impact displacement of the vehicle impacted, and installation of the test equipment. The block in which vehicle impact and displacement occur must be horizontal, flat and uncontaminated, and representative of a normal, dry, uncontaminated road surface. 
2. TEST CONDITIONS 
2.1. The vehicle to be tested must be stationary. 
2.2. The mobile deformable barrier must have the characteristics set out in Appendix 2 to Annex II. Requirements for the examination are given in the Addendum to Appendix 2. The mobile deformable barrier must be equipped with a suitable device to prevent a second impact on the struck vehicle. 
2.3. The trajectory of the median longitudinal vertical plane of the mobile deformable barrier must be perpendicular to the median longitudinal vertical plane of the impacted vehicle. 
2.4. The median longitudinal vertical plane of the mobile deformable barrier must be coincident within ± 25 mm with a transverse vertical plane passing through the R point of the front seat adjacent to the struck side of the tested vehicle. The horizontal median plane limited by the external lateral vertical planes of the front face must, at the moment of impact, be within two planes determined before the test and situated 25 mm above and below the previously defined plane. 
2.5. Instrumentation must comply with ISO standard 6487:1987 unless otherwise specified in this Directive. 
2.6. The stabilized temperature of the test dummy at the time of the side impact test must be 22 ± 4 °C. 
3. TEST SPEED 
Mobile deformable barrier speed at the moment of impact must be ± 50 km/h. This speed must be stabilized at least 0,5 m before impact. Accuracy of measurement: 1 %. However, if the test was performed at a higher impact speed and the vehicle met the requirements, the test is considered satisfactory. 
4. STATE OF THE VEHICLE 
4.1. General specification 
The test vehicle must be representative of the series production, include all the equipment normally fitted and be in normal running order. Some components may be omitted or replaced by equivalent masses where this omission or substitution clearly has no effect on the results of the test. 
4.2. Vehicle equipment specification 
The test vehicle must have all the optional arrangements or fittings likely to influence the results of the test. 
4.3. Mass of the vehicle 
4.3.1. The vehicle to be tested must have the reference mass as defined in Section 2.10 of Annex II to this Directive. The mass of the vehicle is adjusted to within ± 1 % of the reference mass. 
4.3.2. The fuel tank must be filled with water to a mass equal to 90 % of the mass of a full load of fuel as specified by the manufacturer. 
4.3.3. All the other systems (brakes, cooling, etc.) may be empty; in this case, the mass of the liquids must be offset. 
4.3.4. If the mass of the measuring apparatus on board the vehicle exceeds the 25 kg allowed, it may be offset by reductions which have no noticeable effect on the results of the test. 
4.3.5. The mass of the measuring apparatus must not change each axle reference load by more than 5 %, each variation not exceeding 20 kg. 
5. PREPARATION OF THE VEHICLE 
5.1. The side windows must be closed, at least on the struck side. 
5.2. The doors must be closed, but not locked. 
5.3. The transmission must be placed in neutral and the parking brake disengaged. 
5.4. The comfort adjustments of the seats, if any, must be adjusted to the position specified by the vehicle manufacturer. 
5.5. The seat containing the dummy, and its elements, if adjustable, must be adjusted as follows. 
5.5.1. The longitudinal adjustment device is placed with the locking device engaged in the position that is nearest to midway between the foremost and rearmost positions; if this position is between two notches, the rearmost notch is used.

Appendix 1 - Addendum 1 
DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
The required results of the tests are specified in Section 3.2 of Annex II. 
1. HEAD PERFORMANCE CRITERION (HPC) 
When head contact takes place, this performance criterion is calculated for the total duration between the initial contact and the last instant of contact. 
HPC is the maximum value of the expression: 
(t2 - t1)[%gt%NUM%gt%1%gt%DEN%gt%(t2 - t1)t1%amp%int;t2 a.dt]2,5 
where a is the resultant acceleration at the centre of gravity of the head (m/s²) divided by 9,81 recorded versus time and filtered at channel frequency class 1 000 Hz; t1 and t2 are any two times between the initial contact and the last instant of contact. 
2. THORAX PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
2.1. Chest deflection: the peak chest deflection is the maximum value of deflection on any rib as determined by the thorax displacement transducers, filtered at channel frequency class 180 Hz. 
2.2. Viscous criterion: the peak viscous response is the maximum value of V*C on any rib which is calculated from the instantaneous product of the relative thorax compression related to the half thorax and the velocity of compression derived by differentiation of the compression, filtered at channel frequency class 180 Hz. For the purposes of this calculation the standard width of the half thorax rib cage is 140 mm. 
V*C = MAX [(%gt%NUM%gt%D%gt%DEN%gt%0,140) . (%gt%NUM%gt%dD%gt%DEN%gt%dt)] 
where D = rib deflection (in m) 
The calculation algorithm to be used is set out in Addendum 2 of this appendix. 
3. ABDOMINAL PROTECTION CRITERION 
The peak abdominal force is the maximum value of the sum of the three forces measured by transducers mounted 39 mm below the surface on the crash side, CFC 600 Hz. 
4. PELVIS PERFORMANCE CRITERION 
The pubic symphysis peak force (PSPF) is the maximum force measured by a load cell at the pubic symphysis of the pelvis, filtered at channel frequency class 600 Hz. 
Appendix 1 - Addendum 2 
PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE VISCOUS CRITERION (V*C) FOR SIDE IMPACT DUMMY 
The viscous criterion (V*C) is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum. Both are derived from the measurement of sternum deflection. 
The sternum deflection response is filtered once at channel frequency class 180. The compression at time t is calculated from this filtered signal expressed as the proportion of the half width of the Eurosid 1 chest, measured at the metal ribs (0,14 m): 
C(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%D(t)%gt%DEN%gt%0,14 
The sternum deflection velocity at time t is calculated from the filtered deflection as: 
V(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%8 × (D(t + 1) - D(t - 1)) - (D(t + 2) - D(t - 2))%gt%DEN%gt%12 ät 
where D(t) is the deflection at time t in metres and t is the time interval in seconds between the measurements of deflection. The maximum value of t shall be 1,25 × 10-4 seconds. The calculation procedure is shown diagrammatically below:

Appendix 4 
INSTALLATION OF THE SIDE IMPACT DUMMY 
1. GENERAL 
1.1. The side impact dummy to be used for the following installation procedure is described in Appendix 3 of Annex II to this Directive. 
2. INSTALLATION 
2.1. Adjust the leg joints so that they just support the leg when it is extended horizontally (1 to 2 g). 
2.2. Clothe the dummy in form-fitting cotton-stretch underwear with short sleeves and mid-calf length trousers. Each foot is equipped with a shoe. 
2.3. Place the dummy in the outboard front seat of the impacted side as described in the side impact test procedure specification. 
2.4. The plane of symmetry of the dummy must coincide with the median vertical plane of the specified seating position. 
2.5. The pelvis of the dummy must be positioned such that a lateral line passing through the dummy H points is perpendicular to the longitudinal centre plane of the seat. The line through the dummy H points must be horizontal with a maximum inclination of ± 2 °. 
2.6. The upper torso must be bent forward and then laid back firmly against the seat back. The shoulders of the dummy must be set fully rearward. 
2.7. Irrespective of the seating position of the dummy, the angle between the upper arm and the torso arm reference line on each side must be 40 ° ± 5 °. The torso arm reference line is defined as the intersection of the plane tangential to the front surface of the ribs and the longitudinal vertical plane of the dummy containing the arm. 
2.8. For the driver's seating position, without inducing pelvis or torso movement, place the right foot of the dummy on the undepressed accelerator pedal with the heel resting as far forward as possible on the floorpan. Set the left foot perpendicular to the lower leg with the heel resting on the floorpan in the same lateral line as the right heel. Set the knees of the dummy such that their outside surfaces are 150 ± 10 mm from the plane of symmetry of the dummy. If possible within these constraints place the thighs of the dummy in contact with the seat cushion. 
2.9. For other seating positions, without inducing pelvis or torso movement, place the heels of the dummy as far forward as possible on the floorpan without compressing the seat cushion more than the compression due to the weight of the leg. Set the knees of the dummy such that their outside surfaces are 150 ± 10 mm from the plane of symmetry of the dummy.

PARTIAL TEST 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose of these tests is to verify whether the modified vehicle presents at least the same (or better) energy absorption characteristics than the vehicle type-approved under this Directive. 
2. PROCEDURES AND INSTALLATIONS 
2.1. Reference tests 
2.1.1. Using the initial padding materials tested during the type-approval of the vehicle, mounted in a new lateral structure of the vehicle to be approved, two dynamic tests, utilizing two different impactors are carried out (Figure 1). 
2.1.1.1. The head form impactor, defined in 3.1.1, must hit at 24,1 km/h, in the area impacted for the Eurosid head during the approval of the vehicle. Test results must be recorded, and the HPC calculated. However, this test must not be carried out when, during the tests described in Appendix 1 to Annex II to this Directive: 
- there has been no head contact, or 
- the head contacted window glazing only, provided that the window glazing is not laminated glass. 
2.1.1.2. The body block impactor, defined in 3.2.1, must hit at 24,1 km/h in the lateral area impacted by the Eurosid shoulder, arm and thorax, during the type-approval of the vehicle. Test results must be recorded, and the HPC calculated. 
2.2. Type-approval test 
2.2.1. Using the new padding materials, seat, etc. submitted for the type-approval extension, and mounted in a new lateral structure of the vehicle, tests specified in 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.2, are repeated, the new results recorded, and their HPC calculated. 
2.2.1.1. If the HPC calculated from the results of both approval tests are lower than the HPC obtained during the reference tests (carried out using the original type-approved padding materials or seats), the extension is granted. 
2.2.1.2. If the new HPC are greater than the HPC obtained during the reference test, a new full scale test (using the proposed padding/seats/etc.) is carried out.
