Commission Regulation (EC) No 430/2003 
of 7 March 2003 
fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar without further processing 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and the prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white sugar and raw sugar, non-denatured and exported without further processing, are being fixed, account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar, and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account. 
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavour or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content. 
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments. 
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period. 
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. 
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature. 
(8) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the re-importation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans. 
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be fixed at the appropriate amounts. 
(10) The Management Committee for Sugar has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The refunds to be granted on exports of the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, non-denatured and without further processing, are hereby fixed in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the date of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
