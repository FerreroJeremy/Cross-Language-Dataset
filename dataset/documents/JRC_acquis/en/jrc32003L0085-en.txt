Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29%nbsp%September 2003 on Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease repealing Directive 85/511/EEC and Decisions 89/531/EEC and 91/665/EEC and amending Directive 92/46/EEC (Text with EEA relevance.) 
Council Directive 2003/85/EC 
of 29 September 2003 
on Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease repealing Directive 85/511/EEC and Decisions 89/531/EEC and 91/665/EEC and amending Directive 92/46/EEC 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37(3) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(3), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Committee of the Regions(4), 
Whereas: 
(1) One of the Community's tasks in the veterinary field is to improve the state of health of livestock, thereby increasing the profitability of livestock farming and facilitating trade in animals and animal products. At the same time the Community is also a Community of values, and its policies to combat animal diseases must not be based purely on commercial interests but must also take genuine account of ethical principles. 
(2) Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease of biungulates. Although foot-and-mouth disease has no public health importance, due to its exceptional economic importance, it is on the top of list A diseases of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). 
(3) Foot-and-mouth disease is a compulsorily notifiable disease and outbreaks must be notified by the Member State affected to the Commission and other Member States, in accordance with Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982, on the notification of animal diseases within the Community(5). 
(4) The Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease are laid down in Council Directive 85/511/EEC of 18 November 1985 introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease(6). That Directive has been significantly amended on many occasions. Now that new amendments are being made to the said Directive, it is desirable, in order to clarify matters, that the provisions in question should be recast. 
(5) Following the adoption of Council Directive 90/423/EEC of 26 June 1990 amending Directive 85/511/EEC, Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine and Directive 72/462/EEC on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat or meat products from third countries(7), prophylactic vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease was prohibited throughout the Community as of 1 January 1992. 
(6) Preventive measures are necessary to avoid the incursion of foot-and-mouth disease into the Community and into Community livestock from neighbouring countries or through the introduction into the Community of live animals and products of animal origin. There is no indication that any of the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease reported since the prohibition of prophylactic vaccination can be attributed to imports in accordance with Community legislation and subject to veterinary checks at border inspection posts, established in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries(8), and Council Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(9). 
(7) Nevertheless, strict application of the Community rules on imports of animal products aimed at reducing risks should be strongly emphasised, if for no other reason than the increase in trade and movement of persons worldwide. The Member States should ensure that this legislation is implemented in its entirety and make enough personnel and resources available to provide strict controls on the external borders. 
(8) In addition, the European Parliament's Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease found that, in practice, border inspections are failing to prevent significant quantities of meat and meat products from entering the Community illegally. 
(9) Under the conditions of the single market and the overall satisfactory health status of livestock herds, the exchange of animals and animal products has increased substantially and certain regions of the Community have densely populated livestock areas. 
(10) The foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in certain Member States in 2001 demonstrated that due to intensive movement of and trade in animals susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, an outbreak can quickly take on epizootic proportions, causing disturbances on a scale liable to reduce sharply the profitability of farming of animals of susceptible species and other parts of the rural economy and also requiring substantial financial resources to compensate farmers and the application of control measures. 
(11) During the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease crisis, the Commission reinforced the Community control measures for foot-and-mouth disease laid down in Directive 85/511/EEC by adopting protective measures in accordance with Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(10), and Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market(11). 
(12) In 2001, the Commission also adopted Decisions on the conditions for the use of emergency vaccination in accordance with Directive 85/511/EEC. Those conditions were laid down taking account of the recommendations contained in the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on the strategy for emergency vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease of 1999. 
(13) This Directive should take into account the report of expert groups from Member States on a review of Community legislation on foot-and-mouth disease of 1998, which reflects the experience gained by Member States during the classical swine fever epidemic in 1997, and the conclusions of the International Conference on the Prevention and Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease held in Brussels in December 2001. 
(14) The Resolution of 17 December 2002 of the European Parliament on the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in 2001 in the European Union(12), based on the conclusions of the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease of the European Parliament should be taken into account in this Directive. 
(15) The recommendations in the Report of the Thirtieth Session of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease of the Food and Agriculture Organisation on minimum standards for laboratories working with foot-and-mouth virus in vitro and in vivo of 1993, should be taken into account. 
(16) This Directive should also take into account the changes made in the Animal Health Code and the Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines of the OIE (OIE Manual). 
(17) In order to ensure early detection of any possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, legal provisions are necessary to oblige those in contact with animals of susceptible species to notify any suspect case to the competent authorities. Regular inspections should be introduced in the Member States to ensure that farmers are in fact familiar with and are applying the general rules on disease control and biosecurity. 
(18) It is necessary that action be taken as soon as the presence of the foot-and-mouth disease is suspected so that immediate and effective control measures can be implemented once its presence is confirmed. Such measures should be modulated by the competent authorities depending on the epidemiological situation in the Member State concerned. However, the measures should also be reinforced by specific protection measures established in accordance with Community legislation. 
(19) A rapid and detailed diagnosis of the disease and identification of the relevant virus should be carried out under the auspices of a network of national laboratories in the Member States. Where necessary, cooperation between the national laboratories should be ensured by a Community reference laboratory designated by the Commission in accordance with the procedure of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(13). 
(20) With regard to the differential laboratory diagnosis for foot-and-mouth disease, account should be taken of Commission Decision 2000/428/EC of 4 July 2000 establishing diagnostic procedures, sampling methods and criteria for the evaluation of the results of laboratory tests for the confirmation and differential diagnosis of swine vesicular disease(14). 
(21) Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease should be based first of all on depopulation of the infected herd. The killing of infected and contaminated animals of susceptible species should be carried out without delay in accordance with Council Directive 93/119/EEC of 22 December 1993 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing(15). Where possible the processing of the carcasses of dead or killed animals should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption(16). 
(22) It is necessary to integrate public health and environment protection aspects in the event of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, in particular by establishing close cooperation between the veterinary health and environment competent authorities. Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control(17) requires an integrated environmental permit for installations for the disposal or recycling of animal carcasses and animal waste with a specified treatment capacity. Unnecessary risks from burning animal carcasses on pyres or burying them at mass burial sites should be avoided. 
(23) It is necessary to prevent any spread of the disease as soon as an outbreak occurs by carefully monitoring movements of animals and the use of products liable to be contaminated, and where appropriate, in particular in densely populated livestock areas, by emergency vaccination. 
(24) The action taken to control the foot-and-mouth diesease epidemics which struck certain Member States in 2001 has shown that international and Community rules and the ensuing practices have not taken sufficient account of the possibility offered by the use of emergency vaccination and subsequent tests to detect infected animals in a vaccinated population. Too much importance was attached to the trade-policy aspects, with the result that protective vaccination was not carried out even when it had been authorised. 
(25) Various strategies are available for controlling foot-and-mouth disease. In the event of an epidemic, the choice of strategy to control the disease should likewise take account of which strategy causes the least possible economic damage for non-agricultural sectors of the economy. 
(26) By means of emergency vaccination without subsequent killing of the vaccinated animals the number of animals to be killed for disease control purposes may be reduced significantly. Appropriate testing should thereafter substantiate the absence of infection. 
(27) Cleansing and disinfection should be an integral part of the Community control policy for foot-and-mouth disease. The use of disinfectants should be in compliance with Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(18). 
(28) Semen, ova and embryos collected from animals of susceptible species infected with the foot-and-mouth disease virus may contribute to the spread of the disease and should therefore be subject to restrictions in addition to those animal health conditions laid down for intra-Community trade in the following Directives: 
- Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of deep-frozen semen of domestic animals of the bovine species(19); 
- Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importations from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species(20); 
- Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC(21). 
(29) In the event of an outbreak it may be necessary to apply control measures not only to infected animals of susceptible species, but also to contaminated animals of species not susceptible to the disease which may be mechanical vectors for the virus. During the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic, restrictions were also applied on the movement of equidae coming from holdings keeping animals of susceptible species or neighbouring such holdings and specific certification, in addition to the requirements of Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae(22), was required in order to control trade in equidae from Member States affected by foot-and-mouth disease. 
(30) With regard to animal health, the conditions governing placing on the market, trade and imports into the Community of animal products intended for human consumption are laid down in the following Directives: 
- Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat(23); 
- Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting the intra-Community trade of meat products origin(24); 
- Council Directive 80/215/EEC of 22 January 1980 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products(25); 
- Council Directive 91/495/EEC of 27 November 1990 concerning public health and animal health problems affecting the production and placing on the market of rabbit meat and farmed game meat(26); 
- Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations(27), 
- Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption(28). 
(31) Those Directives are now in the process of being replaced. In order to ease reference, the treatment of meat and meat products from animals of susceptible species, required to ensure the destruction of possible foot-and-mouth disease virus, is specified in the Annexes VII to IX of this Directive which are based on those Directives and comply with recommendations of the OIE. 
(32) The animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption are laid down in Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002(29). 
(33) Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products(30) provides for the treatment of milk from animals kept within the perimeters of surveillance zones established in accordance with Community control measures for foot-and-mouth disease. The requirements of that Directive are not sufficient, as they do not provide for treatment of milk from protection zones and from vaccinated animals. In addition, the treatment for milk for human consumption provided for in that Directive exceeds the requirements of the code of the OIE on destruction of foot-and-mouth disease virus in milk and results in logistic problems in the disposal of substantial quantities of milk refused by dairy plants. More detailed provisions on the collection and transport of milk from animals of susceptible species in areas subject to control measures for foot-and-mouth disease should be included in this Directive. The treatment of milk and milk products specified in Annex IX of this Directive complies with recommendations of the OIE for the destruction of possible foot-and-mouth disease virus in milk and milk products. Directive 92/46/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(34) With regard to products of animal origin account should be taken of Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(31). Certain provisions of Directive 92/118/EEC have been included in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. 
(35) The application of the principle of regionalisation should allow the implementation of strict control measures, including emergency vaccination, in a defined part of the Community without endangering general Community interests. Dairy and meat products from vaccinated animals may be placed on the market in accordance with the relevant Community legislation and this Directive in particular. 
(36) Directive 64/432/EEC provides for the definition of regions. Commission Decision 2000/807/EC of 11 December 2000 laying down the codified form and the codes for the notification of animal diseases pursuant to Council Directive 82/894/EEC(32) specifies administrative areas in Member States related to disease control measures and disease notification. 
(37) To guard against emergencies, the Community has, in accordance with Council Decision 91/666/EEC of 11 December 1991 establishing Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(33), established reserves of inactivated foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen stored at designated premises, and the Community antigen and vaccine bank. Transparent and efficient procedures should be established to guarantee access to the antigen without undue delay. In addition, certain Member States have established and maintain national antigen and vaccine banks. 
(38) Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products(34) requires that, with only minor exceptions, all veterinary medicinal products that are placed on the market within the Community hold a marketing authorisation. In addition, that Directive lays down the criteria for the granting of a marketing authorisation for veterinary medicinal products, including immunological veterinary medicinal products. That Directive authorises Member States to permit release onto their market of a product without a marketing authorisation in the event of a serious epidemic under certain conditions. Foot-and-mouth disease has the potential for a serious epidemic. Given the rapid variation of antigen required to produce an effective protection of animals of susceptible species in case of emergency, vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease qualify for the derogation provided for in that Directive. 
(39) The Community Reference Laboratory should advise the Commission and the Member States on the need for vaccines and antigens, in particular where virus strains are detected against which the vaccines produced on the basis of those antigens stored in the Community antigen and vaccine bank do not provide sufficient protection. 
(40) As a matter of precaution, in relation to the risks of a deliberate release of foot-and-mouth disease virus, it is appropriate to apply specific procedures to the procurement of antigens for the Community antigen and vaccine bank and to the publication of certain details relating to disease control measures. 
(41) The presence of an entirely non-immune population of susceptible livestock in Member States requires permanent disease-awareness and preparedness. The need for detailed contingency plans has been proven once more during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic. At present, all Member States have contingency plans approved by Commission Decision 93/455/EEC of 23 July 1993 approving certain contingency plans for the control of foot-and-mouth-disease(35). Such contingency plans should be reviewed regularly, among other things, in the light of the results of real-time alert exercises carried out in the Member States, the experience of the 2001 epidemic and in order to include measures to protect the environment. Member States should be encouraged to organise and carry out such exercises in close cooperation and across borders. The Commission should be encouraged, in cooperation with the Member States, to make provision for the setting-up of technical assistance which could be made available to Member States affected by an epidemic. 
(42) In order to protect Community livestock and based on risk assessment, provision should be made to assist neighbouring third countries infected by or at risk of foot-and-mouth disease, in particular as regards the emergency supply of antigen or vaccines. However, such provisions should apply without prejudice to agreements concluded between the third country concerned and the Community on access to the Community antigen and vaccine bank. 
(43) Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(36), applies in the event of the occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease and provides for Community aid to be granted to reference laboratories and antigen and vaccine banks. Any Community compensation paid to Member States for financial expenditures relating to control measures in the case of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, should be subject to scrutiny regarding compliance with at least the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive. 
(44) In order to ensure close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in controlling foot-and-mouth disease and taking into account the nature of the disease, the Commission should be empowered to modify and adapt certain technical aspects of the control measures. Where necessary, the Commission should base any such modifications or adaptations on the results of a veterinary inspection mission carried out in accordance with Commission Decision 98/139/EC of 4 February 1998 laying down certain detailed rules concerning on-the-spot checks carried out in the veterinary field by Commission experts in the Member States(37). 
(45) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 
(46) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of maintaining and, in the event of an outbreak, of quick recovery of a foot-and-mouth disease and infection-free status of all Member States, to lay down rules on the measures to increase disease preparedness and to control outbreaks as quickly as possible, if necessary by emergency vaccination, and to limit the adverse effects on the production of and trade in livestock and products of animal origin. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty. 
(47) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(38),

CHAPTER II 
CONTROL OF OUTBREAKS OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE 
SECTION 1 
NOTIFICATION 
Article 3 
Foot-and-mouth disease notification 
1. Member States shall ensure that: 
(a) foot-and-mouth disease is listed by the competent authority as a compulsorily notifiable disease; 
(b) the owner and any person attending animals, accompanying animals during transport or looking after animals shall be obliged to notify without delay to the competent authority or the official veterinarian the presence or suspected presence of foot-and-mouth disease and keep animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease or animals suspected of being infected, away from places where other animals of susceptible species are at risk of being infected or contaminated with the foot-and-mouth disease virus; 
(c) veterinary practitioners, official veterinarians, senior staff of veterinary or other official or private laboratories and any person with a occupational relation to animals of susceptible species or products derived from such animals shall be obliged to notify without delay to the competent authority any knowledge of the presence or suspected presence of foot-and-mouth disease they have obtained prior to official intervention within the framework of this Directive. 
2. Without prejudice to existing Community legislation on notification of outbreaks of animal disease, the Member State on whose territory an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or a primary case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals is confirmed shall give notification of the disease and provide information and written reports to the Commission and the other Member States in accordance with Annex II. 
SECTION 2 
MEASURES IN CASE OF SUSPICION OF AN OUTBREAK OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE 
Article 4 
Measures in case of suspicion of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease 
1. Member States shall ensure that the measures provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 are carried out where a holding contains one or more animals suspected of being infected or contaminated. 
2. The competent authority shall immediately activate official investigation arrangements under its supervision to confirm or rule out the presence of the foot-and-mouth disease and, in particular, have the necessary samples taken for the laboratory examinations required to confirm an outbreak in accordance with the definition of outbreak in Annex I. 
3. The competent authority shall place the holding referred to in paragraph 1 under official surveillance as soon as the suspected infection is notified and shall in particular ensure that: 
(a) a census is made of all categories of animals on the holding and that, in respect of each category of animals of susceptible species, the number of animals that are already dead and the animals suspected of being infected or of being contaminated, is recorded; 
(b) the census as referred to in point (a) is kept up to date to take account of those animals of susceptible species born or dying during the period of suspicion. Such information is produced by the owner on request of the competent authority and is checked by that authority at each visit; 
(c) all stocks of milk, milk products, meat, meat products, carcasses, hides and skins, wool, semen, embryos, ova, slurry, manure as well as animal feed and litter on the holding are recorded and those records are maintained; 
(d) no animals of susceptible species enter or leave the holding, except in cases of holdings consisting of different epidemiological production units referred to in Article 18, and that all animals of susceptible species on the holding are kept in their living quarters or another place where they can be isolated; 
(e) appropriate means of disinfection are used at the entrances and exits of buildings or places housing animals of susceptible species and of the holding itself; 
(f) an epidemiological inquiry is carried out in accordance with Article 13; 
(g) to facilitate the epidemiological inquiry, the necessary samples shall be taken for laboratory testing in accordance with point 2.1.1.1 of Annex III. 
Article 5 
Movements onto and off a holding in case of suspicion of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease 
1. Member States shall ensure that in addition to the measures provided for in Article 4, all movement onto and off a holding where there is a suspicion of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is prohibited. That prohibition shall apply in particular to:

SURVEY 
1. Clinical examination 
1.1. Holdings must undergo clinical examinations of all animals of susceptible species for signs or symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease. 
1.2. Special emphasis must be laid on animals which may have been exposed to foot-and-mouth disease virus with a high probability, notably transport from holdings at risk or close contact to persons or equipment that had close contact to holdings at risk. 
1.3. The clinical examination must take into account the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease, including the incubation period referred to in Article 2(h) and the way in which animals of susceptible species are kept. 
1.4. Relevant records kept on the holding must be examined in detail with particular regard to data required for animal health purposes by Community legislation and, where available, on morbidity, mortality and abortion, clinical observations, changes in productivity and feed intake, purchase or sale of animals, visits of persons likely to be contaminated and other anamnestically important information. 
2. Procedures for sampling 
2.1. General provisions 
2.1.1. Serological sampling shall be carried out: 
2.1.1.1. according to the recommendations of the epidemiological team established within the expert group referred to in Article 78, and 
2.1.1.2. in support of tracing and the provision of evidence, taking also into account the definition in Annex I, for the absence of previous infection. 
2.1.2. Where sampling is carried out in the framework of disease surveillance after an outbreak, actions shall not commence before at least 21 days have elapsed since the elimination of susceptible animals on the infected holding(s) and the carrying out of preliminary cleansing and disinfection, unless otherwise provided for in this Annex. 
2.1.3. Sampling of animals of susceptible species shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Annex in each case where sheep and goats or other susceptible animals not displaying clear clinical signs are involved in the outbreak, and in particular where such animals have been isolated from bovine and porcine animals. 
2.2. Sampling on holdings 
In holdings where the presence of foot-and-mouth disease is suspected but in the absence of clinical signs, sheep and goats, and on recommendation of the epidemiological team other susceptible species, should be examined pursuant to a sampling protocol suitable to detect 5 % prevalence with at least 95 % level of confidence. 
2.3. Sampling in protection zones 
In order to seek the repeal in accordance with Article 36 of the measures provided for in Articles 21 to 35, all holdings within the perimeters of the protection zone where sheep and goats have not been in direct and close contact with bovine animals during a period of at least 21 days prior to taking the samples shall be examined pursuant to a sampling protocol suitable to detect 5 % prevalence of disease with at least 95 % level of confidence. 
However, the competent authorities may decide where epidemiological circumstances allow and in particular in application of the measures provided for in Article 36(1)(b), that samples are taken not earlier than 14 days after the elimination of susceptible animals on the infected holding(s) and the carrying out of preliminary cleansing and disinfection, under the condition that the sampling is carried out in accordance with point 2.3 using statistical parameters suitable to detect 2 % prevalence of disease within the herd with at least 95 % level of confidence. 
2.4. Sampling in surveillance zones 
In order to seek the repeal in accordance with Article 44 of the measures provided for in Articles 37 to 43, holdings within the perimeters of the surveillance zone where the presence of foot-and-mouth disease in the absence of clinical signs must be suspected, notably where sheep and goats are kept, shall be examined. For the purpose of this survey the model of a multistage sampling shall be sufficient, provided that samples are taken: 
2.4.1. from holdings in all administrative units within the perimeter of the zone where sheep and goats have not been in direct and close contact with bovine animals during a period of at least 30 days prior to taking the samples, and 
2.4.2. from as many holdings referred to above as necessary to detect with at least 95 % level of confidence at least 1 infected holding if the estimated prevalence of the disease was 2 % equally distributed throughout the zone, and 
2.4.3. from as many sheep and goats per holding as necessary to detect 5 % prevalence of disease within the herd with at least 95 % level of confidence, and from all sheep and goats if there are less than 15 sheep and goats on the holding. 
2.5. Sampling for monitoring 
2.5.1. For monitoring the areas outside the zones established in accordance with the provisions of Article 21, and in particular to substantiate the absence of infection in the sheep and goat population which is not in close and direct contact with non-vaccinated bovine or porcine animals, a sampling protocol recommended for monitoring purposes by the OIE or a sampling protocol as provided for in paragraph 2.4 shall be applied with the difference compared to paragraph 2.4.2 that the estimated herd prevalence shall be set at 1 %. 
3. The number of samples calculated in accordance with requirements in paragraphs 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.3 shall be increased in order to take into account the established diagnostic sensitivity of the test employed.

ANNEX XIII 
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND STANDARDS FOR FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE AND FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF OTHER VESICULAR VIRUS DISEASES 
In the context of this Annex, a %quot%test%quot% refers to a laboratory diagnostic procedure and a %quot%standard%quot% to a reference reagent that has become an internationally accepted standard following a procedure of comparative testing carried out in several different laboratories. 
PART A 
Diagnostic tests 
1. Recommended procedures 
Diagnostic tests described in the OIE Manual, hereinafter the %quot%OIE Manual%quot%, as the %quot%Prescribed Tests%quot% for international trade, constitute the reference tests for vesicular disease diagnosis within the Community. National Laboratories must adopt standards and tests at least as stringent as those defined in the OIE Manual. 
The Commission may, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(2) decide to adopt more stringent testing procedures than those defined in the OIE Manual. 
2. Alternative procedures 
The use of tests defined in the OIE Manual as %quot%Alternative Tests%quot%, or other tests not included in the OIE Manual, is permitted provided that the performance of the test has been shown to match or exceed the sensitivity and specificity parameters laid down in the OIE Manual or in the annexes to Community legislation, whichever is the more stringent. 
National Laboratories generating results for the purposes of national, intra-Community or international trade must generate and store the necessary records demonstrating compliance of their testing procedures with the relevant OIE or Community requirements. 
3. Standards and quality control 
National Laboratories shall participate in periodic standardisation and external quality assurance exercises organised by the Community Reference Laboratory. 
In the framework of such exercises, the Community Reference Laboratory may take account of the results achieved by a National Laboratory which has within a reasonable timespan participated in a quality assurance exercise organised by one of the international organisations responsible for external quality assurance of vesicular virus disease diagnosis, such as OIE, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations or the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
National Laboratories shall operate internal quality assurance programmes. The specification of such programmes may be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(2). Pending the adoption of detailed provisions, the specifications in the OIE Guidelines for Laboratory Quality Evaluation shall apply (OIE Standards Commission, September 1995). 
As part of quality assurance, National Laboratories shall demonstrate compliance of the tests in routine use with the requirements for sensitivity and specificity defined in the OIE Manual, or in Annexe XIV of this Directive, whichever is more stringent. 
4. Procedures for adoption and review of tests and standards for vesicular virus disease diagnosis. 
Tests and standards for vesicular virus disease diagnosis shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(2). 
The Commission may consider the scientific advice produced by the meetings of the National Laboratories to be organised by the Community Reference Laboratory. 
5. Compliance procedure 
Data from standardisation and external quality assurance exercises organised by the Community Reference Laboratory shall be assessed at the annual meetings of the National Laboratories and communicated to the Commission for review of the list of National Laboratories as laid down in Part A of Annex XI. 
Those laboratories whose tests do not meet the prescribed requirements for sensitivity and specificity shall be required by the Commission to adapt their procedures within an appropriate period of time to ensure that these requirements are met. Failure to demonstrate the required level of proficiency within the time limit required shall result in loss of recognition within the Community of all testing performed after that deadline. 
6. Selection and transportation of samples 
An aliquot of field material should be sent to one of the laboratories listed in Part A of Annex XI. However, where such samples are not available or not suitable for transport, animal passage material, obtained from the same host species, or low passage cell culture material is acceptable. 
The history of animal or cell passage material should be provided. 
Samples for vesicular virus diagnosis can be transported at 4 °C if the anticipated transport time to the recipient laboratory is less than 24 hours. 
For oesophageal-pharyngeal (probang) samples, transportation above solid carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen is recommended, especially if delays at airports cannot be excluded. 
Special precautions are required for the safe packaging of material from suspect cases of foot-and-mouth disease both within and between countries. These regulations are mainly designed to prevent breakage or leakage of containers and the risk of contamination, but are also important to ensure that specimens arrive in a satisfactory state. Ice-packs are preferred to wet ice to prevent the possibility of escape of water from the package. 
Prior notice of arrival, and agreement for receipt, must be arranged with the receiving laboratory before despatch of samples. 
Compliance with the import and export regulations of the Member States involved must be ensured. 
PART B

(e) ensure that the foot-and-mouth disease virus isolate is subject to the laboratory procedure required to identify the genetic type of virus and its antigenic characteristic in relation to existing vaccines strains. 
2. If a case of foot-and-mouth disease has occurred in wild animals in an area of a Member State close to the territory of another Member State, the Member States concerned shall collaborate in the establishment of disease control measures. 
3. By way of derogation to the provisions in point 1 specific measures may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(3), if a case of foot-and-mouth disease has occurred in wild animals in an area of a Member State where extensive keeping of domestic animals of susceptible species makes certain provisions in paragraph 1 inapplicable. 
PART B 
Plans for the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals 
1. Without prejudice to the measures laid down in Part A, Member States shall submit to the Commission within 90 days from the confirmation of the primary case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals a written plan of the measures taken to eradicate the disease in the area defined as infected and of the measures applied on the holdings in that area. 
2. The Commission shall examine the plan in order to determine whether it permits the desired objective to be attained. The plan, if necessary with amendments, shall be approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(3). The plan may subsequently be amended or supplemented to take account of developments in the situation. 
If these amendments concern the redefinition of the infected area, Member States shall ensure that the Commission and the other Member States are informed of these amendments without delay. 
If the amendments concern other provisions of the plan, Member States shall submit the amended plan to the Commission for examination and possible approval in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(3). 
3. After the measures provided for in the plan mentioned in paragraph 1 have been approved, they shall replace the initial measures laid down in Part A, on a date which shall be decided upon when approval is given. 
4. The plan mentioned in paragraph 1 shall contain information on: 
(a) the results of the epidemiological investigations and controls carried out in accordance with Part A and the geographical distribution of the disease; 
(b) a defined infected area within the territory of the Member State concerned. 
When defining the infected area, the competent authority shall take into account: 
(i) the results of the epidemiological investigations carried out and the geographical distribution of the disease, 
(ii) the wild animal population in the area, 
(iii) the existence of major natural or artificial obstacles to movements of wild animals; 
(c) the organisation of close cooperation between wildlife biologists, hunters, hunting organisations, the wildlife protection services and veterinary services (animal health and public health); 
(d) the information campaign to be enforced to increase hunters' awareness of the measures they have to adopt in the framework of the eradication plan; 
(e) specific efforts made to determine the number and location of groups of wild animals with limited contacts to other groups of wild animals in and around the infected area; 
(f) the approximate number of groups of wild animals referred to in paragraph (e) and their size in and around the infected area; 
(g) specific efforts made to determine the extent of the infection in wild animals, by investigation of wild animals shot by hunters or found dead, and by laboratory testing, including age-stratified epidemiological investigations; 
(h) the measures adopted to reduce spread of disease due to movements of wild animals and/or contact between groups of wild animals; these measures may include a prohibition of hunting; 
(i) the measures adopted to reduce the population of wild animals and in particular young animals of susceptible species in the wild animal population; 
(j) the requirements to be complied with by hunters in order to avoid any spread of the disease; 
(k) the method of removal of wild animals found dead or shot, which shall be based on: 
(i) processing under official supervision, or 
(ii) inspection by an official veterinarian and laboratory tests as provided for in Annex XIII. Carcasses of all wild animals found positive as regards foot-and-mouth disease shall be processed under official supervision. Where such testing proves negative as regards foot-and-mouth disease, Member States shall apply the measures laid down in Article 11(2) of Directive 92/45/EEC. Parts not intended for human consumption shall be processed under official supervision; 
(l) the epidemiological enquiry which is carried out on each wild animal of a susceptible species, whether shot or found dead. This enquiry must include the completion of a questionnaire which supplies information about: 
(i) the geographical area where the animal was found dead or shot, 
(ii) the date on which the animal was found dead or shot, 
(iii) the person who found or shot the animal, 
(iv) the age and sex of the animal, 
(v) if shot: symptoms before shooting, 
(vi) if found dead: the state of the carcass, 
(vii) laboratory findings; 
(m) surveillance programmes and prevention measures applicable to the holdings keeping animals of susceptible species situated in the defined infected area, and if necessary, in its surroundings, including the transport and movement of animals of susceptible species within, from and to the area; these measures shall at least include the ban of moving animals of susceptible species, their semen, embryos or ova from the infected area for the purposes of intra-Community trade; 
(n) other criteria to be applied for lifting the measures taken to eradicate the disease in the defined area and the measures applied to holdings in the area; 
(o) the authority charged with supervising and coordinating the departments responsible for implementing the plan; 
(p) the system established in order that the expert group appointed in accordance with point 1(b) in Part A can review on a regular basis the results of the eradication plan; 
(q) the disease monitoring measures that shall be enforced after a period of at least 12 months has elapsed from the last confirmed case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals in the defined infected area; these monitoring measures shall stay in place for at least 12 months and shall at least include the measures already enforced in accordance with points (g), (k) and (l). 
5. A report concerning the epidemiological situation in the defined area and the results of the eradication plan shall be transmitted to the Commission and to the other Member States every 6 months. 
6. More detailed rules relating to the establishment of plans for the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(3).
