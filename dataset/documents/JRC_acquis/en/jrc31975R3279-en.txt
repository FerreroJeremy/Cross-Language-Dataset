Regulation (EEC) No 3279/75 of the Council of 16 December 1975 on the standardization of the treatment applied by the individual Member States to imports from non-member countries of live trees and other plants, bulbs, roots and the like, cut flowers and ornamental foliage 
REGULATION (EEC) No 3279/75 OF THE COUNCIL of 16 December 1975 on the standardization of the treatment applied by the individual Member States to imports from non-member countries of live trees and other plants, bulbs, roots and the like, cut flowers and ornamental foliage 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 234/68 (1) of 27 February 1968 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in live trees and other plants, bulbs, roots and the like, cut flowers and ornamental foliage, and in particular Article 8 (2) thereof; 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; 
Whereas Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 234/68 lays down that the necessary provisions will be adopted to coordinate and standardize the import systems applied by each of the Member States with regard to non-member countries; 
Whereas the establishment of the common import system for live trees and other plants, bulbs, roots and the like, cut flowers and ornamental foliage provided for under the aforesaid Regulation requires, for imports from non-member countries, the elimination of quantitative restrictions, measures having equivalent effect, and taxes having equivalent effect to customs duties; 
Whereas it is nonetheless necessary to limit the risks which could ensue from the abolition in trade with non-member countries of all quantitative restrictions or measures of equivalent effect ; whereas the products in question should therefore be included within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 109/70 (2) of 19 December 1969 establishing common rules for imports from State-trading countries, and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1439/74 (3) of 4 June 1974 on common rules for imports from non-member countries; 
Whereas provision should furthermore be made, in respect of particularly sensitive products, for the establishment of a system of import licences requiring that a security be lodged, guaranteeing the undertaking to import during the period of validity of the licence, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 3 
1. All imports into the Community of products subject to surveillance measures pursuant to Title III of Regulations (EEC) No 109/70 and (EEC) No 1439/74 may be made subject, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) 234/68, to the production of an import certificate which shall be issued by the Member States to any interested party who applies for such a licence, irrespective of his place of establishment within the Community. These licences shall be valid for one transaction carried out within the Community. However, for the import of a product which, pursuant to Article 1, paragraphs 2 or 3, is subject to national restrictions in a Member State, the applicability of a licence in that Member State shall be subject to the production of a national document corresponding to a prior import authorization.
