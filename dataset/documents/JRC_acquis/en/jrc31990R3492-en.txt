COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3492/90 of 27 November 1990 laying down the factors to be taken into consideration in the annual accounts for the financing of intervention measures in the form of public storage by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2048/88 (2), and in particular Article 3 (2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 787/89 (4), lays down the general rules for the financing by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, (EAGGF) Guarantee Section, of intervention measures; 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3247/81 of 9 November 1981 on the financing by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, of certain intervention measures, particularly those involving the buying-in, storage and sale of agricultural products by intervention agencies (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3767/89 (6), lays down the rules and conditions governing the annual accounts, which enable the expenditure to be financed by the EAGGF, Guarantee Section, for the intervention measures concerning public storage to be established; however, in the light of experience it is necessary to simplify the existing procedure and to provide that the rules of implementation should be fixed in accordance with a simplified procedure; whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3247/81 should be repealed; 
Whereas, under the agricultural Regulations, intervention agencies buy in products offered for intervention; whereas more detailed rules are needed with regard to the responsibility for the preservation of stored products; whereas the inventories of products stored should be drawn up at regular intervals in order to compare them with stock and financial accounts; whereas financing rules should be laid down to cover quantity losses, deterioration of products, transport of products offered for intervention and recovery of sums from sellers, purchasers and storers; 
Whereas Article 37 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1325/90 (8), provides that the costs of disposal of products of distillation as provided for in Articles 35 and 36 of that Regulation are to be borne by the EAGGF Guarantee Section; whereas more detailed rules with regard to this measure of disposal are needed; 
Whereas the adoption of detailed implementing rules and the procedure to be followed in that case should be provided for,
