Whereas Commission Directive 77/535/EEC (2) provides for official controls for EEC fertilizers for the purpose of checking compliance with the requirements imposed by the Community provisions concerning the quality and composition of fertilizers; whereas that Directive should be amended by adapting Annex I, 'Method of sampling for the control of fertilizers' so that fluid fertilizers can also be checked when Directive 76/116/EEC relating to fertilizers has been extended to fluid fertilizers; whereas a modification has also proved necessary for the control of ammonium nitrate (3) (4); 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives for the removal of technical barriers to trade in fertilizers,
