COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1278/94 of 30 May 1994 amending Regulation (EEC) No 338/91 determining the Community standard quality of fresh or chilled sheep carcases and Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 concerning the Community scale for the classification of carcases of ovine animals and determining the Community standard quality of fresh or chilled sheep carcases 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (1), and in particular Article 4 (2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 338/91 of 5 February 1991, determining the Community standard quality of fresh or chilled sheep carcases (2) applies until the end of the 1993 marketing year, pending the setting up of Community carcase classification standards; 
Whereas sufficient progress in the application of carcase classification has not yet been made to permit the setting up of the standards in question at present; whereas the current standard quality should be extended until the end of the 1997 marketing year; 
Whereas the Commission report on the application of Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92, scheduled for not later than 31 December 1995, should now be envisaged for not later than 31 December 1996 and should be accompanied by a proposal for a new definition of standard quality to apply progressively from the start of the 1998 marketing year; whereas, as a consequence, the objective of compulsory application of the Community scale initially foreseen for 1996 at the earliest, can now be realized in 1999 at the earliest; 
Whereas Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 should be modified to take account of quality requirements in relation to fat class, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
