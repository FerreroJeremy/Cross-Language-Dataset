Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 of 23 July 1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the scheme for the storage of unprocessed dried grapes and unprocessed dried figs 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1622/1999 
of 23 July 1999 
laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the scheme for the storage of unprocessed dried grapes and unprocessed dried figs 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2199/97(2), and in particular Article 9(8) thereof, 
(1) Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 introduces a scheme for the storage of unprocessed dried grapes and dried figs during the last two months of the respective marketing years of these products, consisting of arrangements for the approval of the storage agencies and the payment to them of storage aid and financial compensation; whereas the conditions which the storage agencies must meet in order to be approved should be laid down in particular as regards the steps that are to be taken to ensure that the products are stored properly; 
(2) Whereas the requirements regarding the quality and presentation of the products offered for storage should be determined in such a way as to ensure that storage is carried out under optimum conditions and to prevent it becoming a more attractive outlet than the commercial markets; whereas these new requirements should be introduced on the expiry of a transitional period to enable production to be adapted gradually; whereas the duration of this transitional period should take account of the distinctive characteristics of each sector; 
(3) Whereas, having regard to the arrangements for the payment of the aid for the cultivation of dried grapes referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 and the production aid for dried figs referred to in Article 2 of that Regulation, access to the storage arrangements should be restricted to producer organisations and, in the case of unprocessed dried grapes, to processors, given that the marketing and/or storage of these unprocessed products are undertaken by producer organisations and processors; 
(4) Whereas the procedures for the sale of the products held by the storage agencies and their use should be defined in a manner that will safeguard the financial interests of the Community and give responsibility for determining the technical arrangements for the sale to the Member States; 
(5) Whereas the intervals at which applications for storage aid and financial compensation are presented should be laid down; whereas intervals of one month take due account of the interests of the storage agencies without unnecessarily adding to the administrative burden of the arrangements; 
(6) Whereas the provisions of this Regulation replace, by altering them in the light of changes in the law and experience gained, the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 626/85 of 12 March 1985 on the purchasing, selling and storage of unprocessed dried grapes and figs by storage agencies(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1437/97(4) and of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 627/85 of 12 March 1985 on storage aid and financial compensation for unprocessed dried grapes and figs(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1922/95(6); whereas, moreover, these provisions invalidate the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3263/81 of 16 November 1981 laying down rules covering sales by tender or at prices fixed in advance of dried figs and dried grapes held by storage agencies(7), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1325/84 of 14 May 1984 laying down detailed rules for determining the financial compensation for dried figs and dried grapes for a given marketing year(8), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1707/85 of 21 June 1985 on the sale of unprocessed dried figs by storage agencies for the manufacture of alcohol(9), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3205/85 of 15 November 1995 on the sale by way of invitation to tender of unprocessed dried grapes for specific uses(10), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 682/86 of 4 March 1986 on the sale by storage agencies of unprocessed dried grapes for the manufacture of certain condiments(11), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3937/88 of 16 December 1988 on the sale by storage agencies of unprocessed currants for the manufacture of dried grapes(12) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 913/89 of 10 April 1989 on the sale of unprocessed dried grapes by storage agencies for the manufacture of alcohol(13); whereas the above Regulations should therefore be repealed; 
(7) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,
