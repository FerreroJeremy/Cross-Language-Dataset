Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3985/87 (2), and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 establishes, with effect from 1 January 1988, a combined goods nomenclature based on the Harmonized System which will meet the requirements both of the Common Customs Tariff and the nomenclature of goods for the external trade statistics of the Community; 
Whereas, as a consequence, it is necessary to express the descriptions of goods and tariff heading numbers which appear in Council Protocol No 4 of 24 May 1979 concerning cotton (3), according to the terms of the combined 
nomenclature; whereas these adaptations do not call for any amendment of substance, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

The first provision of Protocol No 4 is replaced by the following: 
'1. This Protocol concerns cotton, not carded or combed, falling within heading No 5201 00 of the combined nomenclature.' 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1988.
