amending Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Articles 26, 33 and 36 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1183/2003(4), grants a derogation under the aid scheme for grape must used to enrich wine for musts from wine-growing zones other than CIII. The derogation expires at the end of the 2002/03 wine year. However, pending a forthcoming in-depth examination of the aid scheme, the status quo should be maintained and the derogation in question extended. 
(2) The distillation rules for wine obtained from grapes classified as both wine grapes and grapes for other uses were slightly adjusted for the 2001/02 and 2002/03 marketing years pending more profound changes. As the preparatory work for these has not yet been completed the adjustments made for 2001/02 and 2002/03 should continue to apply. 
(3) There are technical inconsistencies between certain Articles and paragraphs in Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 that need to be corrected. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 should be amended accordingly. 
(5) The Management Committee for Wine has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
