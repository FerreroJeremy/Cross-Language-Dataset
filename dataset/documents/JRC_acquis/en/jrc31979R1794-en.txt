COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1794/79 of 9 August 1979 amending Regulation (EEC) No 154/75 as regards the financing of the register of olive cultivation 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Whereas it was specified in Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 154/75 of 21 January 1975 on the establishment of a register of olive cultivation in the Member States producing olive oil (2) that part of the aid for the 1973/74 and 1974/75 marketing years granted to producers was to be allocated to finance the work needed to establish a register of olive cultivation; 
Whereas, in view in particular of the large amount of work required, the sum yielded by the aid withheld falls well short of actual needs; 
Whereas therefore the method of financing the extra expenditure required to establish the register should be specified; 
Whereas to this end provision should be made for a part of the production aid referred to in Article 5 of Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 590/79 (4), to go towards the financing of this supplementary expenditure; 
Whereas it is possible that the amount resulting from these deductions will be insufficient to cover the above supplementary expenditure ; whereas, therefore, the possibility of resorting to other deductions to cover any remaining expenditure should be provided for, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
