COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1128/1999 
of 28 May 1999 
laying down detailed rules of application for a tariff quota for calves weighing not more than 80 kilograms originating in certain third countries 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2435/98(2), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1926/96 of 7 October 1996 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the agreements on free trade and trade-related matters with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations(3) and in particular Article 5 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Decision 98/677/EC of 18 May 1998 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Lithuania, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations on agriculture, including improvements to the existing preferential arrangements(4), and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Decision 1999/86/EC of 18 May 1998 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Estonia, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations on agriculture, including improvements to the existing preferential arrangements(5), and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
(1) Whereas Regulations (EC) No 3066/95 and (EC) No 1926/96 and Decisions 98/677/EC and 1999/86/EC provide for the opening of a tariff quota for an annual volume of 178000 live bovine animals weighing 80 kilograms or less originating in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and benefiting from an 80 % reduction in the rate of customs duties; whereas it is necessary to adopt, on a multiannual basis, for 12-month periods beginning on 1 July, hereinafter called the %quot%year of import%quot%, detailed rules of application; whereas, to that end, the annual arrangements provided for in the past for that quota should be applied; 
(2) Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantitioes available should be reserved for %quot%traditional%quot% importers of live bovine animals; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body threaten to restrict access by traders to this part of the quota; whereas there should be provision to correct any harm caused; 
(3) Whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for traders able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals with third countries; whereas, in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported and/or imported during the 12 months preceding the year of import in question by the traders concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load; whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; 
(4) Whereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same trader to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is registered for VAT purposes; 
(5) Whereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to %quot%traditional%quot% traders no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 June preceding the year of import in question; 
(6) Whereas it should be stipulated that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied; 
(7) Whereas, to ensure orderly importation, the issue of the licences should be staggered over the year of import; 
(8) Whereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences; whereas, to this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 168/1999(7), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2648/98(9); 
(9) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
