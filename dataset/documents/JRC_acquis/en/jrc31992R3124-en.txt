COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3124/92 of 26 October 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 on the common organization of the market in hops 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Whereas Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 (3) defines the products which are subject to the market organization; whereas Article 2 of that Regulation addresses the circumstances under which hops and hop products may be certified; 
Whereas since the establishment of the common organization of the market in hops, trade in hop products has become more and more important; whereas it appears necessary to define in greater detail the terms 'hop powder with higher lupulin content' and 'extract of hops' as well as the characteristics of hop products which may be put into free circulation; 
Whereas Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 lays down the conditions producer groups must fulfil in order to be recognized, whereas it has become evident that several recognized producer groups in the Community have experienced great difficulties in practising common marketing of their members' produce; 
Whereas an incentive should be provided to encourage producer groups to market their members' produce in common in order to tive growers a better position in the markt; whereas, for this purpose, the amount of aid 'should be reduced for those producer groups which do not practise common marketing of their members' total production, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
