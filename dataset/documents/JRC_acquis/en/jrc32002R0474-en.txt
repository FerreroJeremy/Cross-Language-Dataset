(1) For technical reasons and in order to conduct suitable checks of the specific supply arrangements for the Azores and Madeira during the transitional period expiring on 30 June 2002, the Portuguese authorities have requested that special provisions should apply to the presentation of licence applications and to their term of validity. That request should be acceded to and the presentation of licence applications should be limited to the first five working days of each month and the term of validity of licences should expire at the end of the second month following that of issue. These new provisions should apply from 1 April 2002.

As a result of that error, difficulties could arise in implementing the specific supply arrangements during the transitional period allowed from 1 January to 30 June 2002 in the French overseas departments, the Azores and Madeira. That error should be corrected so that the issuing of licences can proceed properly during the transitional period.
