THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Whereas: 
(1) For the suckler cow premium, Article 29a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1830/2002(4), lays down a rule for the rounding off of the number of animals for the purposes of calculating the minimum and maximum number of heifers expressed as a percentage.

To ensure equal treatment of all producers, therefore, the application of this rule during this period should be clarified in order to fix the number of heifers where the premium application involves a number equal to two animals. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
