amending Annex XIII (Transport) to the EEA Agreement 
- Draft common position of the Community - (presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In order to ensure the requisite legal security and homogeneity, the EEA Joint Committee is to integrate all the relevant Community legislation into the EEA Agreement as soon as possible after its adoption. 
2. The EEA Joint Committee should therefore adopt the attached draft decision to amend Annex XIII to the EEA Agreement by adding recently adopted acquis in the field of Transport. The decision concerns: 
32004 R 0881 : Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 establishing a European Railway Agency (OJ L 164, 30.4. 2004, p. 1, as corrected by OJ L 220, 21.6.2004). 
3. The draft decision of the EEA Joint Committee provides the framework for the participation of the EEA EFTA States in the European Railway Agency, including in particular provisions on the financial contribution of the EEA EFTA States, on their application of the Protocol of Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities and applicable rules pursuant to the Protocol as well as the modalities for their participation in the committee established by the regulation, i.e. full participation with the same rights and obligations as the EU Member States, except for the right to vote. 
4. Article 1(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning the arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement envisages that the Council establish the Community position for decisions extending Community legislation with substantial changes. 
5. The draft decision of the EEA Joint Committee is submitted for the approval of the Council, after which the Commission will put forward the position of the Community in the EEA Joint Committee at the earliest possible occasion.
