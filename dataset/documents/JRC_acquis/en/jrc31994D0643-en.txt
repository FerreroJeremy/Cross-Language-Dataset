COMMISSION DECISION of 12 September 1994 concerning the withdrawal of authorizations for plant protection products containing cyhalothrin as active substance (94/643/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992, laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8 (2) of Directive 91/414/EEC (1) concerning the placing on the market of plant protection products, and in particular Article 4 (5) thereof, 
Whereas cyhalothrin was one of the 90 active substances covered by the first stage of the work programme provided for in Article 8 (2) of Directive 91/414/EEC (2); 
Whereas for this substance no producer or Member State has notified an interest in obtaining the inclusion of this substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC; 
Whereas it has to be considered that the data required for re-evaluation of this substance will not be submitted in the framework of the work programme and that therefore a decision should be taken with the effect that current authorizations for plant protection products containing this active substance are withdrawn; 
Whereas this Decision does not exclude that in future cyhalothrin is evaluated in the framework of the proceedings provided for in Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1

1. that authorizations for plant protection products containing cyhalothrin are withdrawn within a period of six months from the date of the present Decision;
