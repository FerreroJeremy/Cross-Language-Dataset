Notice of initiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyester originating in Australia, Indonesia and Thailand 
(2005/C 174/05) 
Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry [1] of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyester originating in Australia, Indonesia and Thailand ("the countries concerned"), the Commission has received a request for review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community ("the basic Regulation") [2]. 
1. Request for review 
The request was lodged on 14 April 2005 by CIRFS ("the applicant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 50 % of the total Community production of synthetic staple fibres of polyester. 
2. Product 
The product under review is synthetic staple fibres of polyesters, not carded, combed or otherwise processed for spinning originating in Australia, Indonesia and Thailand ("the product concerned"), currently classifiable within CN code 55032000. This CN code is given only for information. 
3. Existing measures 
The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1522/2000 [3]. 
4. Grounds for the review 
The request is based on the grounds that the expiry of measures would be likely to result in a recurrence of dumping and injury to the Community industry. 
It is alleged that Indonesian exports to other third countries, i.e. the People's Republic of China, Iran, Egypt and Australia, are made at dumped prices. It is further alleged that Thai exports to other third countries, i.e. the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Hong Kong, the United States of America, Vietnam, India, Egypt, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal and the Philippines, are made at dumped prices. In such circumstances, it is alleged that there is a strong likelihood of recurrence of dumping from Indonesia and Thailand to the EU. 
As far as Australia is concerned, the applicants allege that the sole producer of the product concerned with capacity to export is owned by an Indonesian producer of the product concerned and this latter producer is currently subject to a higher anti-dumping duty for Indonesia than for Australia. Given this corporate link, the cost structure for Australian products and the likely export prices to other third markets, it is alleged that there is a strong likelihood of recurrence of dumping from Australia as well. 
The applicant further alleges the likelihood of further injurious dumping. In this respect, the applicant presents evidence that, should measures be allowed to lapse, the current import level of the product concerned is likely to increase due to the existence of unused capacity in the countries concerned. 
It is also alleged that the flow of imports of the product concerned is likely to rise due to the measures in force on imports of the same products originating in the countries concerned in traditional markets other than the EU (i.e. Turkey and India). All this can lead to a redirection of exports of the product concerned from other third countries to the Community. 
Furthermore, the applicant alleges that the situation of the Community industry is still fragile and that any recurrence of substantial imports at dumped prices from the countries concerned would likely lead to a recurrence of further injury of the Community industry should measures be allowed to lapse. 
5. Procedure 
Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an expiry review, the Commission hereby initiates a review in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. 
5.1. Procedure for the determination of likelihood of dumping and injury 
The investigation will determine whether the expiry of the measures would be likely, or unlikely, to lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury. 
(a) Sampling 
In view of the apparent number of parties involved in this proceeding, the Commission may decide to apply sampling, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. 
(i) Sampling for exporters/producers in Indonesia and Thailand 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporters/producers or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the formats indicated in point 7: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in tonnes of the product concerned sold for export to the Community during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in tonnes of the product concerned sold on the domestic market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in tonnes of the product concerned sold to other third countries during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the production of the product concerned and the production volume in tonnes of the product concerned, the production capacity and the investments in production capacity during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005,

- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have cooperated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of exporters/producers, the Commission will, in addition, contact the authorities of the exporting countries, and any known associations of exporters/producers. 
(ii) Sampling for importers 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all importers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the formats indicated in point 7: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, 
- the total turnover in EUR of the company during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the total number of employees, 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the product concerned, 
- the volume in tonnes and value in EUR of imports into and resales made in the Community market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 of the imported product concerned originating in Australia, Indonesia and Thailand, 
- the names and the precise activities of all related companies involved in the production and/or selling of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have cooperated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of importers, the Commission will, in addition, contact any known associations of importers. 
(iii) Sampling for Community producers 
In view of the large number of Community producers supporting the request, the Commission intends to investigate injury to the Community industry by applying sampling. 
In order to enable the Commission to select a sample, all Community producers are hereby requested to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i): 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, 
- the total turnover in EUR of the company during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005,

- the value in EUR of sales of the product concerned made in the Community market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the volume in tonnes of sales of the product concerned made in the Community market during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the volume in tonnes of the production of the product concerned during the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 
- the names and the precise activities of all related companies involved in the production and/or selling of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have cooperated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
(iv) Final selection of the samples 
All interested parties wishing to submit any relevant information regarding the selection of the samples must do so within the time limit set in point 6(b)(ii). 
The Commission intends to make the final selection of the samples after having consulted the parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample. 
Companies included in the samples must reply to a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(b)(iii) and must cooperate within the framework of the investigation. 
If sufficient cooperation is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings, in accordance with Articles 17(4) and 18 of the basic Regulation, on the facts available. A finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party concerned, as explained in point 8. 
(b) Questionnaires 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the sampled Community industry and to any association of producers in the Community, to the sampled exporters/producers in Indonesia and Thailand, to the exporters/producers in Australia, to any association of exporters/producers, to the sampled importers, to any association of importers named in the request or which co-operated in the investigation leading to the measures subject to the present review, and to the authorities of the exporting countries concerned. 
(c) Collection of information and holding of hearings 
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known, submit information other than questionnaire replies and to provide supporting evidence. This information and supporting evidence must reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii) of this notice. 
Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. This request must be made within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii) of this notice. 
5.2. Procedure for the assessment of Community interest 
In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation and in the event that the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury is confirmed, a determination will be made as to whether to maintain or repeal the anti-dumping measures, would not be against the Community interest. For this reason the Community industry, importers, their representative associations, representative users and representative consumer organisations, provided that they prove that there is an objective link between their activity and the product concerned, may, within the general time limits set in point 6(a)(ii), make themselves known and provide the Commission with information. The parties which have acted in conformity with the previous sentence may request a hearing, setting the particular reasons why they should be heard, within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). It should be noted that any information submitted pursuant to Article 21 will only be taken into account if supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. 
6 Time limits 
(a) General time limits 
(i) For parties to request a questionnaire 
All interested parties who did not cooperate in the investigation leading to the measures subject to the present review should, unless sampling provisions apply for them, request a questionnaire as soon as possible, but not later than 15 days after the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
(ii) For parties to make themselves known, to submit questionnaire replies and any other information 
All interested parties, if their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, unless otherwise specified. Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the aforementioned period. 
(iii) Hearings 
All interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40-day time limit. 
(b) Specific time limit in respect of sampling 
(i) The information specified in point 5.1(a)(i), 5.1(a)(ii) and 5.1(a)(iii) should reach the Commission within 15 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, given that the Commission intends to consult parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample on its final selection within a period of 21 days of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
(ii) All other information relevant for the selection of the sample as referred to in point 5.1(a)(iv) must reach the Commission within a period of 21 days of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.

7. Written submissions, questionnaire replies and correspondence 
All submissions and requests made by interested parties must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified) and must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax, and/or telex numbers of the interested party. All written submissions, including the information requested in this notice, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis shall be labelled as "Limited" [5] and, in accordance with Article 19(2) of the basic Regulation, shall be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which will be labelled "FOR INSPECTION BY INTERESTED PARTIES".

8. Non-cooperation 
In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. 
Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
