Commission Regulation (EC) No 1368/95 of 16 June 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90 on aid for the production of casein and caseinates from skimmed milk 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1368/95 of 16 June 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90 on aid for the production of casein and caseinates from skimmed milk 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Article 11 (3) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 (4), provides that aid for the production of casein and caseinates from skimmed milk is only granted where the casein or caseinates produced meet certain composition requirements; whereas experience gained shows that casein containing more than 5 % but not more than 17 % milk protein other than casein no longer meets the current requirements of the market, which is shifting to high-quality products; whereas the aid for such casein should accordingly be discontinued; 
Whereas, in view of the trend on the market in such products on the one hand and in skimmed-milk powder on the other, the aid fixed in that Regulation for skimmed milk processed into casein or caseinates should be reduced; 
Whereas the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Regulation (EEC) No 2921/90 is hereby amended as follows:
