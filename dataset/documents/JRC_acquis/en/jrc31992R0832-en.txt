Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), and in partiuclar Article 14b (4) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas, pursuant to Article 14b of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, the additional flat-rate aid to encourage the formation of organizations of nut and locust bean producers is calculated on the basis of the quantity of nuts and/or locust beans marketed by an organization during the first marketing year which follows the date of its specific recognition; 
Whereas unfavourable weather conditions in a produciton region during the harvest on which calculation of the aid is to be based are likely to create considerable distortions in the application of this additional aid scheme; whereas, in order to ensure proper application of the scheme, provision should be made under Regulation (EEC) No 790/89 (2), at the reasoned request of the producers' organization concerned, for the aid to be calculated in such cases on the basis of the quantity marketed in the marketing year which follows the marketing year which was substantially affected by the abovementioned conditions,
