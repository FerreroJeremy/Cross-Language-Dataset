of 14 June 1982

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Council Directive 77/391/EEC of 17 May 1977 introducing Community measures for the eradication of brucellosis, tuberculosis and leucosis in cattle (4), as last amended by Directive 81/476/EEC (5), restricted the duration of the measures to three years; 
Whereas, in view of the results obtained and of the satisfactory progress of the programmes presented by the Member States, a supplementary two-year measure should be arranged and its financing provided for, in order to achieve the objectives set; 
Whereas Article 29 (3) of Council Directive 78/52/EEC of 13 December 1977 establishing the Community criteria for national plans for the accelerated eradication of brucellosis, tuberculosis and enzootic leucosis in cattle (6) provided that the three-year period originally agreed should begin on the date fixed by the Commission in its decision approving the national eradication plans; whereas, accordingly, the original plans of the Member States, except those for Italy and Greece, expire, for each Member State, on differing dates in 1981; whereas, in order to leave time for technical and financial adaptation in connection with the new measure, the duration of the original plans coming to completion in 1981 should be extended to 31 December 1981 inclusive; 
Whereas, in order to enable any alterations to the original plans necessitated by the epizootiological development of the diseases concerned to be made with a view to successful completion of the measures undertaken, the Member States must prepare new plans; whereas the duration of execution of the new plans must be calculated so that in each case the entire scheme, that is the original plan and the new plan, covers a total period of five years,
