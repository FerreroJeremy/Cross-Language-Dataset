Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organization of the market in hops (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (2), and in particular Article 5 (3) thereof, 
Whereas certain hop-producing non-member countries export some of their production to the Community without, however, providing the attestation of equivalence referred to in Article 1 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2264/91 (4), as a result of not having authorized certain agencies to issue such attestations of equivalence; whereas, however, with a view to avoiding problems for certain operators in the sector, the authorization to use the control attestation should be extended beyond 30 April 1992 for hops originating in countries which are not included in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3077/78 of 21 December 1978 on the equivalence with Community certificates of attestations accompanying hops imported from non-member countries (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2238/91 (6); 
Whereas random checks carried out by the competent authorities of Member States pursuant to Article 7a of Regulation (EEC) No 3076/78 have revealed that certain consignments of hops imported from non-member countries do not conform to the information given in the attestation of equivalence accompanying the products; whereas, therefore, appropriate measures should be taken; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Hops,
