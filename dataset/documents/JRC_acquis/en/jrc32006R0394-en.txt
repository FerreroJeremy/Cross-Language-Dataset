2BTest, Inspection and Production Equipment 
Technical Notes: 
1. Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the centre line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion). 
2. For the purposes of 2B, the number of axes which can be co-ordinated simultaneously for %quot%contouring control%quot% is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative movement within the machine are performed such as: 
a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines; 
b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces; 
c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends. 
3. Axis nomenclature shall be in accordance with International Standard ISO 841, %quot%Numerical Control Machines — Axis and Motion Nomenclature%quot%. 
4. For the purposes of 2B001 to 2B009 a %quot%tilting spindle%quot% is counted as a rotary axis. 
5. Stated positioning accuracy levels derived from measurements made according to ISO 230/2 (1988) [1] or national equivalents may be used for each machine tool model instead of individual machine tests. Stated positioning accuracy means the accuracy value provided to the competent authorities of the Member State in which the exporter is established as representative of the accuracy of a machine model. 
Determination of Stated Values 
a. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated; 
b. Measure the linear axis accuracies according to ISO 230/2 (1988) [1]; 
c. Determine the A-values for each axis of each machine. The method of calculating the A-value is described in the ISO standard; 
d. Determine the mean value of the A-value of each axis. This mean value Â becomes the stated value of each axis for the model (Âx Ây...); 
e. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many stated values as there are linear axes; 
f. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. or 2B201 has a stated accuracy Â of 6 microns for grinding machines and 8 microns for milling and turning machines or better, the manufacturer should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months.

Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows: 
a. Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, %quot%composite%quot%, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or %quot%laser%quot% irradiation. 
N.B. 1 CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes. 
N.B. 2 Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. 
N.B. 3 The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture. 
b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. 
The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. 
The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. 
Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows: 
1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating; 
2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species; 
3. %quot%Laser%quot% Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave %quot%laser%quot% beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating; 
4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition. 
N.B. This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates. 
5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process. 
c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of: 
1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); 
2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and 
3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. 
The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1030 K (757 °C) and 1375 K (1,102 °C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating. 
d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying. 
N.B. 1 Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure. 
N.B. 2 High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 °C) at 0,1 MPa. 
e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. 
f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate. 
N.B. 1 The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials. 
N.B. 2 Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition. 
g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionised, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.

Technical Note: 
In 3A232 the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire or foil) that explosively vapourises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high-explosive material such as PETN (Pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vapourisation of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by a magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator. Also, the word initiator is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.

Execution time %quot%t%quot% is expressed in microseconds, TP and %quot%CTP%quot% are expressed in millions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops) and WL is expressed in bits. 
Outline of %quot%CTP%quot% calculation method 
%quot%CTP%quot% is a measure of computational performance given in Mtops. In calculating the %quot%CTP%quot% of an aggregation of %quot%CEs%quot% the following three steps are required: 
1. Calculate the effective calculating rate R for each %quot%CE%quot%; 
2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP) for each %quot%CE%quot%; 
3. If there is more than one %quot%CE%quot%, combine the TPs, resulting in a %quot%CTP%quot% for the aggregation. 
Details for these steps are given in the following sections. 
Note 1: For aggregations of multiple %quot%CEs%quot% which have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, the calculation of %quot%CTP%quot% is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of %quot%CEs%quot% sharing memory; second, calculate the %quot%CTP%quot% of the groups using the calculation method for multiple %quot%CEs%quot% not sharing memory. 
Note 2: %quot%CEs%quot% that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into the %quot%CTP%quot% calculation. 
TECHNICAL NOTE ON %quot%CTP%quot% 
The following table shows the method of calculating the Effective Calculating Rate R for each %quot%CE%quot%: 
Step 1: The effective calculating rate R 
For %quot%CEs%quot% Implementing: Note: Every %quot%CE%quot% must be evaluated independently. | Effective calculating Rate, R | 
XP only | Rxp = 13 × txp add if no add is implemented use: Rxp = 1txp mult If neither add nor multiply is implemented use the fastest available arithmetic operation as follows: Rxp = 13 × txp See Notes X %amp% Z | 
FP only | Rfp = max 1tfp add, 1tfp mult See Notes X %amp% Y | 
Both FP and XP (R) | Calculate both Rxp, Rfp | 
For simple logic processors not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations. | R = 13 × tlog Where tlog is the execute time of the XOR, or for logic hardware not implementing the XOR, the fastest simple logic operation. See Notes X %amp% Z | 
For special logic processors not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations. | R = R' × WL/64 Where R' is the number of results per second, WL is the number of bits upon which the logic operation occurs, and 64 is a factor to normalise to a 64 bit operation. | 
Note W: For a pipelined %quot%CE%quot% capable of executing up to one arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline is full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective calculating rate (R) for such a %quot%CE%quot% is the faster of the pipelined rate or non-pipelined execution rate. 
Note X: For a %quot%CE%quot% which performs multiple operations of a specific type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or two identical logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is given by: 
t = cycle timethe number of identical operations per machine cycle 
%quot%CEs%quot% which perform different types of arithmetic or logic operations in a single machine cycle are to be treated as multiple separate %quot%CEs%quot% performing simultaneously (e.g., a %quot%CE%quot% performing an addition and a multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two %quot%CEs%quot%, the first performing an addition in one cycle and the second performing a multiplication in one cycle). If a single %quot%CE%quot% has both scalar function and vector function, use the shorter execution time value. 
Note Y: For the %quot%CE%quot% that does not implement FP add or FP multiply, but that performs FP divide: 
Rfp = 1tfp divide 
If the %quot%CE%quot% implements FP reciprocal but not FP add, FP multiply or FP divide, then 
Rfp = 1tfp reciprocal 
If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the effective FP rate is 0. 
Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instruction performs a single logic manipulation of no more than two operands of given lengths. In complex logic operations, a single instruction performs multiple logic manipulations to produce one or more results from two or more operands. 
Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths considering both pipelined operations (if supported), and non-pipelined operations using the fastest executing instruction for each operand length based on: 
1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude extraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on a predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 1). If no register-to-register operations are implemented, continue with (2). 
2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register operations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3). 
3. Memory-to-memory. 
In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by the manufacturer. 
Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL 
Adjust the effective rate R (or R') by the word length adjustment L as follows: 
TP = R × L, 
where L = (1/3 + WL/96) 
Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is the operand length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different lengths, select the largest word length.) 
The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of a floating point processor or unit is considered to be one %quot%CE%quot% with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of bits in the data representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes of the %quot%CTP%quot% calculation. 
This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors which do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP = R. 
Select the maximum resulting value of TP for: 
Each XP-only %quot%CE%quot% (Rxp); 
Each FP-only %quot%CE%quot% (Rfp); 
Each combined FP and XP %quot%CE%quot% (R); 
Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations; and 
Each special logic processor not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations. 
Step 3: %quot%CTP%quot% for aggregations of %quot%CEs%quot%, including CPUs 
For a CPU with a single %quot%CE%quot%, 
%quot%CTP%quot% = TP 
(for %quot%CEs%quot% performing both fixed and floating point operations 
TP = max (TPfp, TPxp) 
%quot%CTP%quot% for aggregations of multiple %quot%CEs%quot% operating simultaneously is calculated as follows: 
Note 1: For aggregations that do not allow all of the %quot%CEs%quot% to run simultaneously, the possible combination of %quot%CEs%quot% that provides the largest %quot%CTP%quot% should be used. The TP of each contributing %quot%CE%quot% is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the %quot%CTP%quot% of the combination is derived. 
N.B. To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously operating %quot%CEs%quot%, generate an instruction sequence that initiates operations in multiple %quot%CEs%quot%, beginning with the slowest %quot%CE%quot% (the one needing the largest number of cycles to complete its operation) and ending with the fastest %quot%CE%quot%. At each cycle of the sequence, the combination of %quot%CEs%quot% that are in operation during that cycle is a possible combination. The instruction sequence must take into account all hardware and/or architectural constraints on overlapping operations. 
Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may contain multiple %quot%CEs%quot%. 
Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer. 
Note 4: %quot%CTP%quot% values are not to be aggregated for %quot%CE%quot% combinations (inter) connected by %quot%Local Area Networks%quot%, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by %quot%software%quot%. 
Note 5: %quot%CTP%quot% values must be aggregated for multiple %quot%CEs%quot% specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory — or multiple memory/%quot%CE%quot%— combinations operating simultaneously utilising specially designed hardware. 
This aggregation does not apply to %quot%electronic assemblies%quot% described by 4A003.c. 
%quot%CTP%quot% = TP1 + C2 × TP2 + … + Cn × TPn, 
where the TPs are ordered by value, with TP1 being the highest, TP2 being the second highest, …, and TPn being the lowest. Ci is a coefficient determined by the strength of the interconnection between %quot%CEs%quot%, as follows: 
For multiple %quot%CEs%quot% operating simultaneously and sharing memory: 
C2 = C3 = C4 = … = Cn = 0,75 
Note 1: When the %quot%CTP%quot% calculated by the above method does not exceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculate Ci: 
Ci = 0,75m 
(i = 2,…,n) 
where m = the number of %quot%CEs%quot% or groups of %quot%CEs%quot% sharing access. 
provided: 
1. The TPi of each %quot%CE%quot% or group of %quot%CEs%quot% does not exceed 30 Mtops; 
2. The %quot%CEs%quot% or groups of %quot%CEs%quot% share access to main memory (excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and 
3. Only one %quot%CE%quot% or group of %quot%CEs%quot% can have use of the channel at any given time. 
N.B. This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3. 
Note 2: %quot%CEs%quot% share memory if they access a common segment of solid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, main memory or other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such as disk drives, tape drives or RAM disks are not included. 
For Multiple %quot%CEs%quot% or groups of %quot%CEs%quot% not sharing memory, interconnected by one or more data channels: 
Ci = 0,75 × ki (i = 2, …, 32) (see Note below) 
= 0,60 × ki (i = 33, …, 64) 
= 0,45 × ki (i = 65, …, 256) 
= 0,30 × ki (i %gt% 256) 
The value of Ci is based on the number of %quot%CE%quot%s, not the number of nodes. 
where 
ki = min (Si/Kr, 1), and 
Kr = normalising factor of 20 MByte/s. 
Si = sum of the maximum data rates (in units of MByte/s) for all data channels connected to the ith %quot%CE%quot% or group of %quot%CEs%quot% sharing memory. 
When calculating a Ci for a group of %quot%CEs%quot%, the number of the first %quot%CE%quot% in a group determines the proper limit for Ci. For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 %quot%CEs%quot% each, the 22nd group will contain %quot%CE%quot%64, %quot%CE%quot%65 and %quot%CE%quot%66. The proper limit for Ci for this group is 0,60. 
Aggregation (of %quot%CEs%quot% or groups of %quot%CEs%quot%) should be from the fastest-to-slowest; i.e.: 
TP1 ≥ TP2 ≥ … ≥ TPn, and 
in the case of TPi = TPi + 1, from the largest to smallest; i.e.: 
Ci ≥ Ci + 1 
Note: The ki factor is not to be applied to %quot%CEs%quot% 2 to 12 if the TPi of the %quot%CE%quot% or group of %quot%CEs%quot% is more than 50 Mtops; i.e., Ci for %quot%CEs%quot% 2 to 12 is 0,75. 
TECHNICAL NOTE ON %quot%ADJUSTED PEAK PERFORMANCE%quot% (%quot%APP%quot%) 
%quot%APP%quot% is an adjusted peak rate at which %quot%digital computers%quot% perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications. 
%quot%APP%quot% is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT), in units of 1012 adjusted floating point operations per second 
Abbreviations used in this Technical Note 
n number of processors in the %quot%digital computer%quot% 
i processor number (i,...n) 
ti processor cycle time (ti = 1/Fi) 
Fi processor frequency 
Ri peak floating point calculating rate 
Wi architecture adjustment factor 
Outline of %quot%APP%quot% calculation method 
1. For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the %quot%digital computer%quot%. 
Note In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions and/or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating point operands of 64-bits or more, the effective calculating rate R is zero. 
2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 
3. Calculate %quot%APP%quot% as %quot%APP%quot% = W1 x R1 + W2 x R2 + … + Wn x Rn. 
4. For %quot%vector processors%quot%, Wi = 0.9. For non-%quot%vector processors%quot%, Wi = 0.3. 
Note 1 For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as addition and multiplication, each operation is counted. 
Note 2 For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate. 
Note 3 The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the %quot%APP%quot% of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer. 
Note 4 Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating %quot%APP%quot%. 
Note 5 %quot%APP%quot% values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by %quot%Local Area Networks%quot%, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by %quot%software%quot%.
