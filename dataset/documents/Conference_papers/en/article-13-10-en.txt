Our work aims at providing the community with a lexicon that can be directly used by a parser. We focused on syntactic aspects and extended the work to some semantic elements, like semantically linked sets of prepositions (as LOC). The generated lexicon is freely available and is expected to be integrated into larger resources for French, whether existing or under development.
