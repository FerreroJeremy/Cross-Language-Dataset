Abstract. Over the recent years, several methodologies and tools for the automatic construction of ontologies from textual resources have been proposed. In this article we first analyze four of these approaches by comparing them with a reference approach – Methontology. We choose approaches which cover all the steps of the ontology construction process. Then, for some tools associated with the previously analyzed approaches, we analyze their performances and compare their results with manually obtained results.
