Experimentation We made an experiment with a unique run of the engine over the lexical network. The purpose is to access the production of the inference engine along with the blocking and filtering. Then from the set of supposedly valid inferred relations, we took a random sample of 300 propositions for each relation type and undertook the validation / reconciliation process. The experiment conducted is for evaluation purpose only, as actually the system is running iteratively along with contributors and games.
