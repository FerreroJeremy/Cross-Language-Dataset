Intuition The measure should assess to which extends a query (respectively, a log), which is a set of references (respectively, of queries), is a faithful summary of another query (respectively, another log). The operators of QSL define summaries by adding or removing references to their operands. For instance the lca operator summarizes by adding references containing ancestors. The measure should thus assess the proportion of what is added or removed to define the summary. This is achieved by adapting the classical notion of precision and recall.
