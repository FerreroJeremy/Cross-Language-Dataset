Introduction Research in meaning representation in NLP is an important problem still addressed through several approaches. The NLP team from LIRMM currently works on thematic text analysis and lexical disambiguation [Lafourcade, 2001]. To this purpose, we built a system, with automated learning capabilities, based on conceptual vectors for meaning representation. Vectors are supposed to encode `ideas' associated to words or expressions. The conceptual vectors learning system automatically defines or revises its vectors from definitions in natural language contained in electronic dictionaries for human usage.
