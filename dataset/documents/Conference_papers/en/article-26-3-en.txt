Configuring consists in building (a simulation of) a complex product from components picked from a catalog of types. Neither the number nor the actual types of the required components are known beforehand. Components are subject to relations (this information is called "partonomic"), and their types are subject to inheritance (this is the taxonomic information). Constraints (also called well formedness rules) generically define all the valid products. A configurator expects as input a fragment of a target object structure, and expands it to a solution of the problem constraints, if any. This problem is undecidable in the general case.
