        A delegation from the South African Parliament is seated in the official visitors' gallery.
        I would like to warmly welcome the South African delegation, which is here to participate in the 10th EP-South Africa interparliamentary meeting, to be held from 5 to 6 September.
      
      
        (Applause)
