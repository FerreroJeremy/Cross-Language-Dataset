      - After the vote on Amendment 10:
    
    
      
        (FR) Madam President, I think you need to repeat the vote on Amendment 1, because there was the same majority that voted in favour of Amendment 1.
        You rushed the gun in saying that it had been rejected.
      
    
    
      
        I think it is too late.
        It was clearer for me on the first vote than it was on the subsequent ones.
        I am sorry, but I have made my mind up on that one.
