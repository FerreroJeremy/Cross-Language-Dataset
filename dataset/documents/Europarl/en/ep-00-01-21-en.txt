        Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news.
        There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.
        Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.
        On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.
      
      
    
    
      
        Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.
        We had heard about this regrettable incident.
        Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society.
        I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.
      
      
        (The Minutes were approved)
