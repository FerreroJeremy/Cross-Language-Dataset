      Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union (vote)
    
    
      - Piecyk report
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (DE) I beg to point out that Amendment 1 should not be placed after paragraph 4 but after paragraph 146; that was agreed with the author of the amendment.
        This paragraph does not belong at the beginning but at the end of the resolution.
        I would be grateful if you could arrange for that to be done.
      
    
    
      
        Our efficient staff have already seen to that.
