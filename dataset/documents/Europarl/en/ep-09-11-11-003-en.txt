        It is with great sadness that I have learnt of the death on 17 October of our former fellow Member, Lady Diana Elles.
        Lady Elles was a Member of the European Parliament from 1973 to 1989 and performed the roles of Vice-President of the European Parliament from 1982 to 1987 and of Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
        Please rise and observe a minute's silence in memory of our late colleague.
