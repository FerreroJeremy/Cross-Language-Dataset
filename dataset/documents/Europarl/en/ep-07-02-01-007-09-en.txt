      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        Mr President, I have a small point concerning Amendment 1, which I tabled as shadow rapporteur on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
        That was correct, but I should have also said that the original author was Professor Trakatellis.
        I apologise to him for not including his name.
        I would hope that the inclusion of his authorship will encourage wider-spread approval across this House for a good amendment.
