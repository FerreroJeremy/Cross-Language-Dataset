      The humanitarian situation of Iraqi refugees (vote)
    
    
      Joint resolution.
    
    
      - Before the vote on the draft resolution:
    
    
      
        Mr President, on a point of order, before you put the motion for a resolution to the vote, in the interests of fairness I think the ALDE Group should recognise that but for the PPE-DE Group's presence here this afternoon, its amendments would not have been passed.
        I think there should be consistency in our criticism about presence in this Chamber.
