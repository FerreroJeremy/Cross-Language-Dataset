        rapporteur. - Mr President, just briefly, I was very honoured to be a rapporteur when we had the chance to repeal, instead of adopting, a piece of legislation.
        This is a redundant piece of legislation.
        I think it fits perfectly with our long-term goal, which is to legislate and to regulate better, so I can only recommend all of you to support this repeal.
        I would like to thank you for that in advance.
