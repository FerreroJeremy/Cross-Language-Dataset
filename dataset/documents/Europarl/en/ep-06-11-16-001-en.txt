      (The sitting opened at 10.00)
    
    
      
        Mr President, I rise simply to report to the House the good news that last night the President of Pakistan, who was our guest a few weeks ago, has commuted the death sentence on my constituent Mirza-Tahir Hussain, who had been on death row for 18 years but is widely regarded to be innocent of the charges against him.
        A number of Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Karim, were going to Pakistan next month to make a final plea.
        Now, of course, we shall turn our efforts towards ensuring Mr Hussain can return to Leeds by Christmas.
      
      
        I am delighted at this news and hope that the President of Parliament will make a statement later today.
        I know he has worked very hard on this case, as have other Members of Parliament.
      
      
        (Applause)
