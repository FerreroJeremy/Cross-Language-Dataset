      Regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (vote)
    
    
      - Leinen report
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, last Friday, the Council accepted the essential content of this Regulation on the funding of parties and foundations at European level.
        In addition, this morning, a trialogue took place with the Commission and the Council, and we reached agreement on the questions that remained to be settled.
        Therefore, there is a realistic chance of adopting this project at first reading and creating the prerequisites for better financing even for 2008.
      
      
        I therefore suggest that we postpone the vote until 29 November, at the next plenary, in Brussels.
      
      
        (Parliament approved the proposal)
