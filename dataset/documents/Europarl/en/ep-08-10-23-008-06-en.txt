      Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Bosnia and Herzegovina (
    
    
      - On paragraph 22
    
    
      
        draftsman. - (DE) Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 22, which I have agreed with other fellow Members.
        We must correct the text because it does not exactly represent the truth.
        After the Missing Persons Institute and following the semi-colon, we should change the sentence.
        I will read the change out in English now:
      
      
        - 'urges the corresponding urgencies at the entity level to support the work of the state-level bodies by forwarding to them all the relevant information they gather;'.
      
    
    
      
        (DE) That is paragraph 22.
        I do not see any opposition, so we will vote on it.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was accepted)
