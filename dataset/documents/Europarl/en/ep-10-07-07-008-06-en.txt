      Before the final vote:
    
    
      
        Madam President, thank you for this impressive majority.
        There is only one thing which I would like to say.
        This postponement should be seen as one of Parliament's strengths, rather than its weaknesses.
        We know that we are in a position to judge the new European supervisory package for the financial markets purely on the basis of whether it includes strong powers at a European level.
        We will not allow ourselves to be pressurised.
        We will give the Council time to adopt a sensible position that we can vote on.
