        rapporteur. - Mr President, there seems to be broad agreement between the groups on two oral amendments to this report.
        One is to combine paragraphs 6 and 22, to bring the trade-related positions to the same paragraph.
        The second one is on rephrasing and streamlining paragraph 19 on the accountability of human rights defenders.
        I hope these can be adopted.
