        I declare resumed the session suspended on Thursday, 12 March 2009.
      
      
      
        First, I would like to welcome the new Secretary-General of the European Parliament, Klaus Welle, who is sitting on my left, and to wish him all the best in his endeavours.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
      
        On my right is David Harley, the Deputy Secretary-General.
        He represents, so to speak, continuity within the Secretariat.
        I would also like to wish him all the best.
      
      
        (Applause)
