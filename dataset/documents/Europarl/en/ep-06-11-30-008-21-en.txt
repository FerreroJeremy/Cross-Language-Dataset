      Specific programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Seventh Research and Training Framework Programme, 2007-2011) (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        Mr President, I am the shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group.
        Yesterday we had a vote based on information regarding Amendments 22 and 23.
        We knew that the different fusion associations held different views.
        I should therefore like to tell my group that we have received a letter from the Fusion Association stating it is unanimously in favour of the way in which we voted in committee.
        Therefore, I should like to ask colleagues to change their vote on Article 2(2) and vote against those amendments.
