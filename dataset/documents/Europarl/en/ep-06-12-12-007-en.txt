        Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has already presented to plenary the reports by Mrs Kudrycka, Mrs Segelström and Mr La Russa on the legislative proposals for which the Commission requests use of the urgency procedure.
        We believe that, from a political point of view, the compromise that we have been able to achieve with the other institutions is acceptable, and we are therefore in favour of plenary adopting these reports during this part-session.
