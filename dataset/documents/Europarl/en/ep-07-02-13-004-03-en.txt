        Mr President, it is not much use me speaking once the vote has happened, so all I want to say is that you need to keep more of an eye out in future.

        We have wrapped up this topic in just one reading, and we will be spending some EUR 100 million on fighting fraud over the coming years.
        That is what I wanted to tell the House.
