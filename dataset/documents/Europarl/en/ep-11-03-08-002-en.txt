        Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
        Today, 8 March, is International Women's Day.
        Parliament has planned numerous events.
        This is an opportunity for us to join in the celebrations of the centenary of this day and to express our thoughts on what women have achieved and what still remains to be done.
