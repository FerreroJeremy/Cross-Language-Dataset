      2009 discharge: EU general budget - European Parliament (
    
    
      
        Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to table an oral amendment to this paragraph.
        It is a fairly technical amendment, but it is still significant.
        I propose that the future tense be replaced by the perfect tense for points i), ii) and iii).
        Indeed, the measures referred to in these passages were implemented a long time ago - over two years ago.
        It is pointless, then, to request things for the future when they are already being applied in the present.
        I think that even this venerable Parliament can accept this basic principle.
      
      
        It should therefore read: 'the European Parliament notes that the option of drawing a reduced pension from the age of 50 and the option of receiving a lump sum equivalent to 25% of pension rights have been abolished'.
        It should read: 'the retirement age for the Scheme has been raised from 60 to 63'.
        It should read: 'the managers of the Fund have been called upon to adopt ...'.
      
      
        (Applause)
