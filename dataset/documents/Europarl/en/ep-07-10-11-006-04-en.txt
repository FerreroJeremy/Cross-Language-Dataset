      Financing the common agricultural policy (vote)
    
    
      - Report: Jorgo Chatzimarkakis
    
    
      - Before the final vote:
    
    
      
        (DE) Madam President, in this House, neither the lift system nor the bell is working.
        That is the reason why many of us did not manage to get here on time, so perhaps we could ask the relevant services to get the bell to actually ring, please.
      
    
    
      
        The vote was scheduled for 11.00 and we have tried to start on time.
