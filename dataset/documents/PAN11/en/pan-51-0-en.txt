 To which Inca
Yupanqui said that to him, as his father, pisase begged him that he had not won victory for
him women were similar pisasen Urco Inca and his brethren; pisase is what he as a person to whom he
had for his wife and his father, otherwise he would go.

And being in this, he called Viracocha a gentleman who had it, and talking him alone, he said secretly
sacase warriors who had him, that he might bear é to a certain stream of forest and high straw
which was secretly, and so while Quél was, Quel Terni in words to Inca Yupanqui in a room,
while he ambush people there, and inside the room, if he could, he would kill her hands, and
that if there escape, he killed him in the ravine of the mountain and do was to turn to return
the Inca Yupanqui. And it concluded, that man went out to do what
he commanded Viracocha Inca.

Viracocha Inca Yupanqui and he returned to comenzóle speak with good words and to show happy
face. Since you paresció I would have done what his captain that he had commanded rose Viracocha
Inca and Inca Yupanqui begged metiese things that went from Uscovilca in the room do before
he had prayed that sends meter, so that pisase Urco Inca child and then to the pisase him.
He again repeated that answer Inca Yupanqui the pisase him if he wanted, and if not he would go, as
I had said. And when Viracocha Inca could not finish him the Inca pisase Urco, thinking of killing
him inside the room, said to send him get into the room, quests themselves, it would step
in front of. And being in this contention, they came to Inca Yupanqui his three good friends,
and suspecting Viracocha Inca betrayal that I wanted to do, would
not consent to enter the Inca Yupanqui room.

And being in this, he reached his Inca Yupanqui a captain of the people he care brought, and said
they had seen some people out there Peñol war, which had left one by one and two by two, and
that was plenty of people that had left, and some of them carried spears and halberds, and
that he went by the way do they had been, he suspected aquesta were to take some step in as soon
as he return, or that were to take and what they steal in this city of Cuzco had, and to take
it. And as at this tell him that his captain ahead of his three good friends, she laughed to see
Inca Yupanqui his father wanted to kill that way, and knowing that reigned envy him, and estándole
begging him to serve it all and that it acetic service. And as I had heard what that captain was
telling, he said to the two of those three friends them to take half people in his care he had
brought there, and he was suffering and had left the Peñol them to betray him, for so the winters
including one to one and two by two, which were in siguimiento of that Viracocha was winter,
and who would look if these go into hiding in some hills or ravines, and if they went to Cuzco
and they look forward they saw and understood, return to him tell him what happened ANSI, for
him, with understanding and being warned of what it was, give orders on what he had to do with
those who remained, and that if case was that they had made such an ambush, there were right and
understanding do dello, hiciesen high, or getting no warning so that the enemies they had understanding
that they had understood, and which were then quite soon, because he completed in briefly
with his father, and they look forward hiciesen then return.

And thus, his good two friends, begging [herself besought him sore] that enter via any alone
in the room with her father because he was not killed in some treachery, and the same charge
to Mayta Apu, who was with him, look after his master, and so they did these two gentlemen and
sent do fall within Inca Yupanqui was two hundred Indians with their axes in their hands, sent to
them which it was made around where Inca Yupanqui was, and to mirasen and beware, do not be
made any treachery. To other people that there was, they sent to stay at the door do Inca Yupanqui
was and that if they feel some people DIN inside, enter at once all
and who would look for his master.

And this fact, people who took the Inca Yupanqui had commanded them, and throwing forward fifty
Indians, one by one, two by two, covered with their blankets (like that), very discreetly, and well
who had left had sent ahead saliesen Inca Viracocha, which fifty Indians were discovered, looking
for his enemies. And as they were scattered and large space each other, an Indian one of those
who went ahead as they came together at the broken firing and stream discharge was do the straw,
saw the enemy ambush, which, as they saw looming, dejáronse all fall on the straw, I thought I
had seen. And this Indian as the saw, sat on the floor and made to tie spent some tie his shoes,
dissimulation which was a sign and warning to his companions that behind came, which, as might
see him in the way that you have heard of one another became the new to the two gentlemen
who behind them came, which, as it was understood that ambush, sent to all yours is collected
and together there they do the voice had taken, except at fifty that had gone before, whom I commanded
that went around looking at and discovering those who were in the ambush if they left or went
ahead, and send to that tied shoes, coming a lowly Indian to him which tell him showing that tied
and untied shoes and other things of his to bring, which might show
dissimulation of what had understood.

And leaving it in this state, back to Inca Yupanqui, who, as provided on hobiese what you heard,
begged his father to prison pisase those logos there Uscovilca had brought him, which said Viracocha
Inca, who did not want to, if not stepped Urco first Inca, and Inca Yupanqui to this he said that
because he was her father and I have respect dalle obidient and as such their Lord, had he been
there to his people that he pisase, and beg him to ansímismo returned to their village and
city of Cuzco, for he, like his father and in his name he had won that company, he wanted
out of there and go to town Cuzco and enter succeeding with those captains and Uscovilca things,
because that had been his intention and to which he had come there, that another way, that
he had not Quél bring what they had gained such pisase Urco Inca, his eldest son. And finish
saying that his father Inca Yupanqui Inca Viracocha, ordered to take the clothes and the rest
of Uscovilca, and ordered the prisoners to lift the soil, which until that hour had been lying
on the ground, and so he got out Inca Yupanqui, and run angry that his father had not stomping
on prisoners and their loved what you heard. And his father had pesábale be so wrong with
him that he wanted to kill and bring about death, seeing it in himself that he had not given
cause wherefore of angry e hobiese had ill will, but before attempting and had sought to make all
service, and make all pleasure and contentment, and how they know that anger and passion of it
thou had was for envy to see quel escedia all his brethren, both
had some passion for it.

In craving is left where his father was, considering these and many other things, and how came
to do her two good friends were with the people waiting and warned tiniéndole the army had betrayed
him, make him sloppy thinking, said to his captains there three parts that would make these people,
and that the two Dell were divided, one by of the way, and the other on the other, and the
other to go there with him, and that these two parts craves were divided, were disguised as could
be, and that he would enter for the path and through the woods, and that should give to do the
ambush, and their captains should say: C ac'ayacha acacia, which says to them, them! [28],
then the people come out, which ANSI was encircling the mountain,
and they should fall into the enemy, and that without respect to anyone,
not dejasen none to life.

And this fact and ANSI provided, these people left care in the way that you have heard, é Inca
Yupanqui was the craves, and going on the right path, and came to the creek, Inca Yupanqui,
do the mountain was ambushed and he was done, and I went to the middle of it, leading his people
looking and advised of what they suspected, tiráronle [29] within the mountain stone Inca Yupanqui
and not to hit him, but they gave to one of the had litters, and seen this for Inca Yupanqui
and his three best friends, said aloud: To them, to them!, And as
his people, had already surrounded the mountain, you hear his voice,
gave in the ambush in such a way that no man escaped.

And when he was Inca Yupanqui to the city of Cuzco, he ordered his friend to return Vicaquirao his
father Inca Viracocha, and tell him to come to his city, which had saved things and those for
Dell triumph, and so he ordered to go aside with him three thousand men and accompany him
to be kept. And thus, broke Vicaquirao, and that was to come do Penol Viracocha was, found him
crying was big for him and his death Inca Yupanqui who were killed in the ambush, which had been
dead many masters top of that he had, and since he had new Viracocha Inca Cuzco towards that
large crowd of people came to war, had turned his son over him to kill her to him and to theirs
that it had, and went there in brief consultation with his own in which they agreed, that if war
came upon him and his son that he would talk if they came from some concert or another thing that
was Pedilla allegiance, to do everything that he was asked by é defendant. É to know who came, or
how there came the demand came, sent Viracocha a man to come out of those with him were placed
in mourning and crying, and he was suffering the same with him ten other Indians in the same
way, and to go aside Peñol one after another, and queste master to be in front and behind the Indians
were, of what art mirasen received them People who craves leave, if they caught or to some anger,
and what you might see him again ANSI to warn.

And thus, this gentleman came in the way and that, and they came to do Vicaquirao came and
arrived to him, made his reverence, and the same to him Vicaquirao and as ANSI come see him
crying, asked her what had been passion, though he suspected it was either because he had died
by his hands a brother in the ambush. The man told her that crying for that his brother had died
in the ambush, all of which the Vicaquirao scolded him and told him be poorly done and agreed.
The master replied that he was not culpante it, and Viracocha Inca had provided without giving
the party. Vicaquirao replied to this, that if Viracocha Inca I had provided, what they had
gained there to keep it, not so aina reinstating friends and relatives that there was lost.
The man said that since this was done, and that It had not to do or talk, mad that it had provided
under Viracocha Inca, that begged him to tell him that I went back and what was their demand.
Vicaquirao told him, and then one man told the weapon Vicaquirao had given them and agree that
they had had, and that in such an agreement had been agreed, and to what he had left. All of
which is heard by Vicaquirao, it took a very big laugh to him and his men who were there around,
and was so wins the laugh, that the gentleman laughed with them. Ansi, all together they went to
do was Viracocha Inca, and how craving were a space, it Vicaquirao begged to let him go ahead
to secure to Viracocha Inca, who had left to him and stirred up all their own with and fear
of what he had said, and so they went to do this man was and told Viracocha Vicaquirao to
what was. And from then little, came Vicaquirao to do the Inca Viracocha, and made him their
compliance, and said the embassy from Inca Yupanqui you have already brought him ear, which
responded Viracocha Quél baggy waited until it again if I did not understand to Cuzco, having
left the flight, it was something shameful, and it would not be to him enter the city, having
been homeless and having a boy victory, as was his son Inca Yupanqui was there that do Penol
of Cayucos Xaquixaguana [30], thought make a village with people who had them and thought die there,
and that more will not wait in Cuzco, who believed more in him to enter his days. And he did
Viracocha Inca, settled at that Penol on the summit of Calca, seven leagues from Cuzco, and
made the most of the people stone houses.

And he understood and learned all the more that were in the Peñol Viracocha, the Inca Yupanqui
was so warlike and so friendly to everyone, which he knew from childhood, and had to be master,
as he was, and having done such a large company, could not leave to make large grants to them
that he arrived and he wished to serve, and considering this, too many people, of which there
Viracocha had it, went to the city of Cuzco. Inca Yupanqui was with a happy face, and craves
desculpábansele such were the and tell him that if he had desmamparado, which his father had
brought, and he responded to this that it was said, he had no anger against them, if you had
gone with his father, who had done as good, that his father was his Lord and all of them. I look
forward, as they arrived do he was comin 'from where his father was, the rescibia well, and gave
them land, women, and houses, and clothes, and never took any thing to which he had left there
when his father out, as were houses, land, stores food, and clothes that had their homes ANSI
left, before telling the such, that he had been in the custody of their estates, which, as
understood them who had gone to recreate his father that he had been in care of their estates
all, everyone looked if anything was missing from his home, he and guard who was left of them,
they would realize Dell, and that none would be missing something. All of which he had made to
provide: and sent to certain gentlemen who do not consent to enter anyone in any house that
had been left deserted ANSI, because he always had that such dwell on them, costing each of
them on their great magnificence, it would return each a longing
that his house, and so they became, as I have heard.

É Vicaquirao turning to speak of, who had been with persuading and begging Viracocha that wanted
to come to his city, which could never kill it, and after three days there was in his company,
costing it Viracocha Inca was not wanting to return to Cuzco, turned Vicaquirao. Come to the
city of Cuzco, Inca Yupanqui said the response to Inca Viracocha told that you have heard,
and everything else that he passed all of which heard by Inca Yupanqui,
grieved, seeing that his father would come to be Lord as was.

And seeing that, he ordered all his people together with him that this was, he would say more than
fifty thousand men of war, and these were the neighboring towns were Messrs. to give him, if
people had that as they saw the crowd of people for Inca Yupanqui came, and as he had been of help,
lanzáronse them with all their people to help him, with people who craves leave for Inca Yupanqui,
[t] ANSI given for these neighbors. And they say that the battle had just given to Uscovilca,
and victory there by Inca Yupanqui Viracocha people that you invest, then he disappeared and did
not see it most outstanding fifty or sixty thousand men, who were
those who mixed their neighbors between people who have heard.

And making people pool their Inca Yupanqui, ordered a favorable answer before all the spoil of battle,
taking the best thing that dello paresció, to sacrifice dello Viracocha by the favor and give him
victory of his enemies, and all the rest of dispossession gave é distributed to all nations, according
to their quality and services. And that was known by the roundness and district this city the
great splendor of the Lord and knew how to gratify the services,
there in all round great satisfaction, and so they will come many
chiefs and people to be I offer all parts and have the Lord.

And while Inca Yupanqui in this way and have heard, a messenger came to him a captain his, that
this was in the custody of the city, two miles of it, trying to know his enemies what they
were doing on the board do it together, for which he sent him to say, that masters who escaped the
battle fled Uscovilca Matos to do, now you have heard, Xaquixaguana orchestras and redone in natural
and confederates with her, and that of their land I had been a lot of people and relief, and that
ansimismo arrived there were already four other Uscovilca captains Paucaray that he will discover
winters Condesuyo provinces é Andesuyo, which history has told you,
that as we were all together, they left another daily in the morning
to give him battle, and to avenge the death of his master Uscovilca.

Known by the new Inca Yupanqui, ordered three good friends and to the chiefs and gentlemen in his
court and had been service, which then together the people of war and the right to bring forth
out of the field, each with their weapons, and that included all one by one. And removed and
counted, they found the number one hundred thousand men of war, which he had gathered people for the
great reputation of Se released. And they say that the enemies who were about two hundred miles men.
And thus, Inca Yupanqui sent four squadrons that were made this her people, sending each chief
lord of the Indians who were there, were leaders of their people, and so scattered, [Name?] By
generals of the three companies to his three good friends, taking for himself the one of them,
and they provide all the necessary weapons, ordered to march his field in search of his enemies
who, as they knew they were coming out of Cuzco, turned about to return Xaquixaguana to where
he waited. And the Inca Yupanqui with his people, the day of battle, as he saw the sight of
their enemies, and break and front with them, say that again face back to see his people and
squads, which were divided and each by itself [And] say that so many people saw him at that time
had arrived to help him, which have failed, and his enemies afrontóse took them in half and
giving them everywhere that was so cruel and so fierce the battle, which began already high sun,
it would be to When ten, according to them they say, and he was known Vespers della victory by
Inca Yupanqui, where they were killed by the Inca Yupanqui more than thirty thousand men, and
Chance, who were the enemy, was no man to life, among whom were that
the natives had gone Xaquixaguana, and had made censering [31] the
hair.

And called the victory and defeated the battle, they parted to one side all of Xaquixaguana,
and everyone went in front of Inca Yupanqui, and echáronsele by land, to which the Inca Yupanqui
wanted to kill to have seen the death of their own. Inca Yupanqui it defended himself, saying he
should not kill, if the Chancas had been found, it would for being the gasket in the ground, and
they could not do anything, and they were saying ansímismo the same words and gave the same satisfaction.
And then sent Inca Yupanqui, that because were dried apricots, then they were shorn her hair
and so they themselves were shorn all, seeing the will of the Inca and seeing them to worship
in it, and brought Becausethe Inca Yupanqui and Cuzco was twirling ride. And this was done,
commanded them that they were all his people, and to live in peace, and he ordered his captains
not consenting to aquesta of Xaquixaguana they should be made no
anger or being taken, any thing, and if anything of their estates
in that they were taken spoil, then the hiciesen return.

And then ordered that all prisoners were brought before him, to whom, as there were, asked what
had been the cause, provided that, was his great power, which hiciesen battle it again? And
still there among the prisoners there were incurred the Uscovilca four captains who went to discover,
as history has told you, [Said, responded] that the cause that moved them to the board that
they did in giving battle, which was to have seen his fortune was great in the days that had
gone é land they had conquered, giving reason for the battles there and in such recuentros day
each of them had been, and that none of them had never been unfortunately but had always been victorious,
and how it had acaescido them, having to always his victory was on foot, who had wanted to give
this battle, thinking that restore loss of their Lord, and avenge his death. In reply Inca Yupanqui,
who had looked wrong, and that if they were men of understanding, which were to presume that
if they had been victory for the land that they said they had gone, they had to consider that
had been in their Lord Uscovilca chance that in such demand had winters, and as hobiesen they
saw and learned that his Lord was defeated and dead, who had presumably I was finished and
the chance, and that he did not already have them, and that they were é mirasen punished and
others hear it, that this place would be punished them and all other: and again because they
were not [to] make people, which to him were uneasy and cause them that other orchestras will be
found innocent in such cases where they lost lives, as had been very many of them [to] the
junta had done together, which at that site would be punished. And thus, he sent them to bring
before him, and that the site would do the battle, and for hobiese della memory, in the presence
of all its field should command drive many clubs which were hanged, and after seasoned [hanged]
their heads were cut and placed on top of the sticks, and their bodies were burned there and made
powders, and from the highest hills were dispersed through the air, desto hobiesen that memory.
