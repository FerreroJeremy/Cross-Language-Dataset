 It's a drowning man, is another burning alive a burning house,
and this is in honor of humanity, who seldom lack for saving ventures, be thrown into the raging
waves or flames. However, the saving hero perhaps a few days earlier had refused to give alms
to the real two-person saved now so generously. Conversely, the most graceful ever consider the
sacrifice that is made for them a small sum of money, that of life itself. And this for a
thousand reasons very fair. Life is sacrificed or exposed to anything, the money does not. No
ragamuffin not have a life exposed as any other life, but not everyone has money display or sacrifice.
The tightrope walker, the tamer of beasts, the bricklayer standing on a scaffold, the miner
who enters a mine unsafe, in short, almost all men risk their lives for anything, for a miserable
wage, for a paltry amount of money. What did Edgardo more by Lucia di Lammermoor, which became
more D. Suero de Quinones by the lady of your thoughts that he can do and makes every moment,
with less noise, the last lost, to earn a few pesetas? Therefore, a considerable amount of
pesetas worth more than the courage of Edgardo and the gallantry of D. Serum.

It is clear that the poor, but can love, can not express your love
so clearly and as bright as the rich.
