 At last
dared to say:

- Do not dance V.?

- If V I had fun so far and would be within the circle - said getting
seriously.

- Yo! - Said the girl calmly.

- Yes, you .-- Miguel released
to say it Do not laugh .-- V. case: I never dreamed of dancing; but
less now that I am in such good company.

The girl was so frightened yet, he did not know thank you. Guessing concern our young, dispensed
with the usual jokes and began to treat him with more respect. Enterose gently on the details
of his life and was slowly gaining confidence, making it speak more disengage.

But the ball was crushed. Some young people left for their homes, others, and with them some leading
men, came to sit in front of the tobacconist, for which they Dona Rosalia consented to get
more chairs and a long bench. Miguel sat next to Maxi.

- Remove V. guitar, Dona Rosalia - said one of the girls.

- Will
you sing Johnny?

Juanito was the pilot of steam where our young man had arrived. It was well-known Andalusian
in Pasajes.

As came the guitar, began to brighten up the conversation with T-shirts, polo shirts and flamenco
dancers. Miguel, to the surprise of beautiful girls that were there, leaning back in the chair,
began to speak to the ear Maximina. What do you say? Nothing, nonsense: it was going very nicely,
it was a very nice girl, she was glad to have come to stop his house,
etc. Maximina, more surprised than confusing, listened with a smile
that music so new to it (Michael, not the pilot).

Our youth spent time in the best I could, waiting for time to go
to bed.

- Why not feel V. Paulina next? - asked the girl.

- Who
is Paul?

- That girl so beautiful that it is near the door.
