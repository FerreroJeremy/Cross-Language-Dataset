 

I started running like crazy, at night, taking a rag from the heart of Magdalena manojillo of flowers
that had her lips and printed as I savored bites like kisses. Walking at random, drunk with joy, repeating
a phrase that dazzled me as the light of a rising sun. I was not concerned nor the time or the
streets. After having lost ten times in the neighborhood of Paris who knew better got to the docks.
I found them to anyone.
