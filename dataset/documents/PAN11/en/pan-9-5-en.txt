 

As concluded VS expressing some mistrust of the project, and is convinced, according to I said,
that concur in Mr. Alvear, great talent, extensive instruction, infinite skill and heroic virtues,
one suspects that it has adopted the draft in deference to so great man. If I had to determine,
also despise my opinion to follow that of the Lord, but as I was not sent by Mr. Viceroy accede
to vote but say Ageno mine, I can not fail to note, I see no grounds for VV.
