 Of "what happened
yesterday," there was much more, and with some care to not heard from the bedroom as I could
impress again. It was a miracle of God that we do not hear most of it, because with the stubborn
determination I had in that there should be something between Lita and physician I was really
heavy and insistent in certain passages of dialogue, particularly during Mari Pepa getaway to the
bedroom, because my uncle had coughed or believed that he had called ... or to see if I needed something,
but coughed or call. At Don Pedro Nolasco had known all, shortly before going on "the cloud" that
had terrified. They had lived in the same anguish I late into the night.
