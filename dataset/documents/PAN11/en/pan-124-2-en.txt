 Everything discussed in the coffee: the mysteries of the Court, the Government's conduct
and Chambers, the manifestations of the press, causes and noisy sentences, large scandals, international
events and the glorious victories of the writer and the bullfighter, the speaker and the songstress.
Depth discussions, perorations eloquent and gallant, chronic scandalous, frivolous and great
things, delusions and light business, and still loves terrible burning and stirred passions
in this sanctuary bustling and essentially democratic. Those who have not studied a little cafe in
Madrid and Barcelona, ??Seville and Cadiz, not know one of the most marked phases of Spanish society.

For
the rest, coffee is not for the Spanish but an element of association,
since apart to be very sober they have no taste for coffee or drink
know.

What is milk made very very slightly sweetened with brown dye, and have a fancy to drink in
a glass glass, to keep warm. They are not power but in terms chocolate and wine. Are averse
to bitter coffee, as it revels in the oil rancid. Everyone has their tastes and that there is
no dispute.

After these quick observations, a word more about Madrid political
and social Subject to insist upon it elsewhere.

As long as the friction with people of good company allowed me to learn the situation of the
middle class in Spain, I noticed several things: first, which left literate youth dominate
much of the trend towards metaphysics German, sterile in a country that, having no free discussion,
what you need is to receive a strong momentum in economic via stirring in a great movement that
occurs due to backlash moral regeneration. Second, that youth, all liberal, and tending towards
a single purpose - the progress - is in great disagreement, so strange quirk that Democrats and free-changers
or economists seem to be in antagonism. The talents seem divorced from each other dominated by absolutism
of ideas or systems that have a lot of scholastic.
