The Grevisse (Grevisse, 1997) grammar, in its paper version, allowed us to check some intuitions concerning the obsolescence or usage of some prepositions.
The TLFi (Tr´esor de la langue franc¸aise informatis ´e), that we consulted through the CNRTL, and that offers a slightly different list of prepositions.
