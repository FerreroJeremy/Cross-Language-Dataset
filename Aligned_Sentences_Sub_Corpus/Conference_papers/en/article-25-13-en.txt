Error Rate Comparison First, in order to verify that these changes in the recognition module allowing a partial analysis to IF do not degrade the performance of the initial speech recognition system, we have compared the error rate between initial system and our new system.
The Word Error Rate (WER) obtained with the initial system using classes constructed manually was 31.9% while the WER obtained using the new LM, and after reconstructing French text from the IF-classes, is 32.9%.
Thus we can say that the new LM does not introduce significant ASR performance degradation.
