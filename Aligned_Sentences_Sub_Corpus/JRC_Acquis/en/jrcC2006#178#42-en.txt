Pleas in law and main arguments Infringement of freedom of establishment (Articles 43 and 48 EC and Article 31 EEA): the territorial restriction, which consists of the fact that only expenses incurred in respect of R%amp% D and IT activities actually carried out in Spain may benefit from the deduction of the corporation tax allowance, is a factor which restricts the freedom of establishment of Spanish companies which invest in R%amp%D and IT outside Spain, benefiting companies making the same investment in Spain, in particular, undertakings which have their main office in another Member State and which operate in Spain via a secondary establishment.
Infringement of the freedom to provide services (Articles 49 EC and 36 EEA): the costs of R%amp%D and IT activities subcontracted outside Spain are not eligible for the deduction of the corporation tax allowance.
