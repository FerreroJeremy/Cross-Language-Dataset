The teaching and learning of languages is of special relevance among neighbouring Member States. (18) The interim evaluation reports of the existing Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes and the public consultation on the future of Community activity in education and training revealed a strong and in some respects growing need for continuing cooperation and mobility in these fields at European level.
Hitherto, however, participation by such enterprises in the Leonardo da Vinci programme has been limited.
Suitable arrangements, similar to those that exist under the Erasmus programme, should be made for the recognition of the outcomes of such mobility. (28) Given the particular educational challenges facing the children of occupational travellers and mobile workers in Europe, full use should be made of the opportunities available under the Comenius programme to support transnational activities targeted at their needs. (29) Increased mobility throughout Europe should be accompanied by constantly higher standards. (30) In order to respond to the increased need to support activities at European level designed to achieve these policy objectives, to provide a means of supporting trans-sectoral activity in the fields of languages and ICT, and to strengthen the dissemination and exploitation of results of the programme, it is appropriate to complement the four sectoral sub-programmes with a transversal programme. (31) In order to respond to the increasing need for knowledge and dialogue on the European integration process and its development, it is important to stimulate excellence in teaching, research and reflection in this field by supporting higher education institutions specialising in the study of the European integration process, European associations in the fields of education and training and the Jean Monnet Action. (32) It is necessary to provide sufficient flexibility in the formulation of this Decision to allow for appropriate adjustments in the actions of the Lifelong Learning Programme to respond to changing needs during the period from 2007 to 2013, and to avoid the inappropriately detailed provisions of previous phases of Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes. (33) In all its activities, the Community is to aim to eliminate inequalities, and promote equality, between men and women, as provided for in Article 3(2) of the Treaty. (34) Further to Article 151 of the Treaty, the Community is to take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures.
The evaluation should include an external evaluation to be conducted by independent, impartial bodies. (42) In its Resolution of 28 February 2002 on the implementation of the Socrates programme [12] the European Parliament drew attention to the disproportionately onerous administrative procedures for grant applicants under the second phase of the programme. (43) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [13] and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC,Euratom) No 1605/2002 [14], which safeguard the Community's financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. (44) Radical administrative simplification of application procedures is essential for successful implementation of the programme.

[1] OJ L 292, 15.11.1996, p. 2. [2] OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1. -------------------------------------------------- STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I.
The Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 10 February 2005. [1] 3.
The European Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on 25 October 2005. [3] 5.
On 24 July 2006, the Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty.
As a result, the minimum allocation for the Grundtvig Programme rises to 4 %.
Amendments 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 40, 42, 47, 49, 51, 59, 60, 62, 64, 67 and 68 have been included in full.
Amendments 5, 8, 9, 12, 19, 20, 24, 26, 31, 32, 36, 39, 48, 50, 58, 69 and 71 have been accepted in part or reworded. 3.2.
Although the Council was also unable to accept the Parliament's proposal in amendment 70 on the indicative budget breakdown for the four main sub-programmes, as set out in Annex B.11, its final position remained close to that of the EP.
The Council felt that amendment 34 was unacceptable because it was unclear which persons and bodies could be considered as responsible for lifelong learning policies "at European level".
Against this background, Council looks forward to reaching an agreement with Parliament in the near future with a view to the early adoption of the Decision. [1] OJ C 221, 8.9.2006, p. 134 [2] OJ C 164, 5.7.2005, p. 59 [3] doc. 13675/05 --------------------------------------------------
