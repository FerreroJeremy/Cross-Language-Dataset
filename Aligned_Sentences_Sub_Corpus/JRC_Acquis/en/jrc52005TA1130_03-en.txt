For the other 36 countries, only a few have been able to supply complete and reliable data".
Moreover, the Court, in its annual report for 2003, stressed the key importance of the report on the use of funds that the recipient ACP State has to send to the Commission (Article 212 of the revised Lomé convention).
For this to be successfully undertaken, it is a precondition that the 43 Stabex-receiving countries should provide reliable annual accounts on the use of Stabex. | 10.
The EDF is to shift to accruals-based accounting with a view to adhering to the IPSAS [15] standards by 1 January 2005.
In the current practice (articles 102 and 135 of the Financial Regulation of the ninth EDF), the report is already in its definitive version as of 31 May, based on the provisional accounts established on 30 April.
The accounts are published in their definitive form on 31 October.
The Court mainly notes that: | 12. (a) a number of key items of information deserve to be included, or complemented, or better put in their context, in the report on the financial management; (a) The financial management report highlights the most significant events and the detailed information is displayed in the financial statements. | (b) the Commission has not set out in the report the main actions remaining to be taken as a result of the Stabex inventory in the ACP States; (b) The Commission has given instructions and set priorities for its delegations, which have to work with the National Authorising Officers of the 43 Stabex-receiving countries in order to obtain the necessary data, and also ensure proper use of the Stabex funds still to be disbursed.
The European Court of Auditors (the Court) has examined the accounts of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth EDFs and the underlying transactions for the financial year ending 31 December 2004.
While progress has been achieved, further improvements need to be made in the following areas: (a) risk management (see paragraphs 20 to 22); (b) control framework (see paragraphs 23 to 33); (c) accountability for internal control of Delegations (see paragraphs 34 and 35); (d) Activity Report of the Director General of EuropeAid (see paragraph 36).
This monitoring work is given a separate chapter in the management report.The Commission will continue its efforts to identify which advances must be recovered in this way. | 15.The balance of provisions for doubtful debts recorded in the accounts (0,03 million euro) does not reflect the real level of bad debts within the 18 million euro of recovery orders issued.
As a consequence, an unknown part of the bank balance claimed of 832 million euro has not been ascertained by the Commission on the basis of reliable documents. | 16.The Commission is seeking, through its delegations, to obtain a clearer picture of the utilisation of Stabex funds by means of the annual Stabex reports, in standard format to facilitate global reporting.
However improvements still need to be made in the following areas (see paragraphs 20 to 36). | | Risk management: improved but still too global 20.Around 2500 million euro is spent every year through a myriad of entities.
The optional ex ante control was discontinued in 2005, following the reorganisation of EuropeAid. | | 27.The ex ante control checked 6 % of transactions effected in 2004 and identified various types of errors in 6 % of them, allowing corrective action to be taken.
The Court reviewed a random sample of 23 transactions checked by the second-level ex ante control and found that, except in cases of minor importance, the control operated effectively. | | Ex post control needs to be better documented 28.EuropeAid established an ex post control in June 2004 for the verification of transactions already processed.
The control, resulting from the desk examination of supporting documentation only, has the objective of checking 3 % of payments, including clearances of advances, so as to identify one-off and recurrent errors, identify the potential for improving procedures and provide additional assurance that payments are regular and legal.
The extent of the checks is more focused than that of the optional ex ante control. | | 29.Due to insufficient staff resources, only the first three quarters of the 2004 quota had been checked at end of January 2005 representing 1 % of payment transactions compared with the objective of 3 %. | 29.Although below the target of 3 % of the number of financial transactions passing through the information systems, the ex post controls covered 14 % of the total financial volume of 2004 transactions. | 30.The Court reviewed a sample of 51 transactions out of the transactions checked by ex post control and found that, except in cases of minor importance, the control operated sufficiently effectively.
The 2004 audit plan comprised 35 audits at headquarters, while the delegations' audit plans totalled 426 audits.The monitoring of audits and the possible issue of a recovery order are the responsibility of the devolved delegation.
According to the same principle, the Heads of Delegation are accountable to that Director, who in turn is accountable to the Director-General of EuropeAid (see Articles 21(1) and 25 of the Financial Regulation).

Calculate and adjust the provision for doubtful debts | 1.3 | Inventory and use of the Stabex funds | No information in the accounts on the use of Stabex funds | Omission to be remedied, since the Commission shares responsibility for the use of these funds | The Commission is unable to verify the use to which Stabex funds are put (Article 212 of Lomé IV), and there is inadequate authorisation of bank transfers | Obtain all the reports on the use of Stabex funds from the national authorising officers, and strengthen internal checks on bank transfers | The inventory of Stabex funds is completed but the amounts of funds available in the bank accounts are not reliable (832 million euro).
Information on the use of Stabex funds is insufficient | Investigate further in order to obtain more reliable figures for funds available in the banks.

As regards the reorganisation of the various departments of EuropeAid, the new arrangements came into effect on 16 March 2005.
The revision of the Cotonou Agreement of June 2005 includes a new Article 19b which goes in the direction recommended by the Court (tender procedure with suspension clause). | Conclusion 51.

LEGAL BASIS The budget is governed by the financial provisions of the Rome Treaties [2] [3] (Articles 268 to 280 EC and Articles 171 to 183 Euratom) and by the financial regulations [4]. 3.
It is thus important to establish the following two totals for each financial year: (a) the total of appropriations for commitments (AFC) [6] = non-differentiated appropriations (NDA) + commitment appropriations (CA) [6]; (b) the total of appropriations for payments (AFP) [6] = non-differentiated appropriations (NDA) + payment appropriations (PA) [6].
