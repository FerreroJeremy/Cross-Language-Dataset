Once the projected redundancies are notified in accordance with article 1 and 3 of Directive 75/129/EEC[3], the affected workers could receive assistance as soon as possible.
The second-phase consultation of social partners on corporate restructuring and European works councils under Article 138(3) of the Treaty was launched on 31 March 2005[4].
Specific action outside the Structural Funds is deemed necessary to provide targeted support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns where such redundancies have a significant negative impact on the regional or local economy.
Subsidiarity and proportionality The Community may take steps, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty, to promote the objectives of solidarity.

Review clause The proposal includes the possibility of a review, after the Commission has submitted the first annual report, with a view to responding better to the objectives and scope set out in Article 1 of the Regulation. 2006/0033 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing the European Globalisation adjustment Fund THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third paragraph of Article 159, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[5] Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[6], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[7], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251[8], Whereas: (1) Notwithstanding the overall positive effect of globalisation on growth and jobs in the Community, it is opportune to establish a European Globalisation adjustment Fund (hereinafter referred to as "the EGF"), through which the Community would show its solidarity towards workers affected byredundancies resulting from changes in world trade patterns; (2) The EGF should provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the re-integration into employment of workers in areas or sectors suffering the shock of serious economic disruption;. (3) Actions under this Regulation should be defined according to strict intervention criteria relating to the scale of economic dislocation and its impact on a given sector or geographical area, to ensure that the financial contribution from the EGF is concentrated on the most seriously affected parts of the Community. (4) The activities of the EGF should be coherent and compatible with the other Community policies and comply with its acquis. (5) An action funded under this Regulation should not receive financial assistance from other Community financial instruments. (6) Community aid should only be given upon application of the affected Member State.
The Commission should ensure equal treatment of the requests submitted by the Member States. (7) To facilitate implementation of this Regulation, expenditure should be eligible from the date at which a Member State begins to provide personalised services to the affected workers, following the notification of projected redundancies, in accordance with Directive 75/129/EEC[9].
Reflecting the need for a concentrated response aiming specifically at re-integration into employment, a deadline should be laid down for the use of the financial contribution of the EGF. (8) The Member State should remain responsible for the implementation of the financial contribution and for the management and control of the actions supported by Community financing, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[10].
The Member State should justify the use made of the financial contribution received. (9) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 Intervention criteria A financial contribution from the EGF shall be provided where major structural changes in world trade patterns lead to a serious economic disruption, notably a massive increase of imports into the EU, or a progressive decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to third countries, which results in: (a) at least 1000 redundancies in an enterprise, including workers made redundant in its suppliers or downstream producers, in a region where unemployment, measured at NUTS III level, is higher than the EU or national average, or (b) at least 1000 redundancies, over a period of 6 months, in one or more enterprises in a sector, measured at NACE 2 level, which represents at least 1% of regional employment measured at NUTS II level.
Article 3 Eligible actions A financial contribution under this Regulation shall be made for actions, as part of a coordinated package of personalised services designed to re-integrate redundant workers into the labour market, including: (a) active labour market measures, such as job-search assistance, occupational guidance, tailor-made training and re-training including ICT skills, outplacement assistance and entrepreneurship promotion or aid for self-employment; (b) special in-work time-limited income supplements, such as job search allowances, mobility allowances, income support allowances to individuals participating in training activities; and temporary wage supplements for workers of at least 50 years of age who accept to re-enter the labour market at a lower wage.
Article 4 Type of financial contribution The Commission shall award a financial contribution in the form of a single instalment, which shall be implemented within the framework of shared management between the Member States and the Commission, in accordance with Article 53, paragraph 1, point b) and paragraphs 5 and 6 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.
