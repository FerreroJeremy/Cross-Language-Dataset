Proposal for a Council Decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo /* COM/2006/0207 final - CNS 2006/0068 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 12.05.2006 COM(2006) 207 final 2006/0068 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission proposes to provide exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo in the form of a grant with a view to alleviating the financial situation of Kosovo, supporting the development of a sound economic and fiscal framework, facilitating the continuation and strengthening of essential administrative functions and addressing public investment needs.
The proposed macro-financial assistance will be limited in time, complement support from the World Bank (through IDA funds) and other bilateral donors, and will be conditional on progress in the implementation of a number of measures, in particular in area of public finance, to be defined in close consultation with the IMF and the World Bank.
Economic developments in 2004 and 2005 reflected this trend and the lack of dynamism of the economy.
Inflation had been negative in the second half of 2004 and first part of 2005, and the consumer price index fell by 1.9% on average in 2005.
After an expansionary fiscal stance in 2004, budget consolidation is taking place and the budget deficit has come down to around 2.8% in 2005, down from 5.4% of GDP in 2004 and below planned levels owing to lower than foreseen capital expenditure.
In October 2005, IMF staff agreed with the authorities of Kosovo on a fiscal framework for the remainder of 2005 and for 2006.
According to the LOI, the deficit would need to remain below 3% of GDP in 2006.
The submitted MTEF anticipates the budget deficit to be close to the upper limit of 3% of GDP foreseen in the LOI, and to reach respectively EUR 76 million and EUR 67 million in 2006 and 2007.
Owing to lower than foreseen expenditure in 2005, cash reserves have remained substantial and may finance a large share of the deficit in 2006.
Nevertheless, upon exhaustion of these reserves, urgent financing needs are expected to arise towards the end of 2006 and particularly in 2007 when the budget deficit would need to be entirely financed from external support in order to keep cash reserves at a minimum of around EUR 50 million.
Accordingly, external financing needs, subject to possible adjustments in the upcoming revised version of the MTEF, are expected to amount to EUR 14 million in 2006 and EUR 67 million in 2007.
In order to address these needs, the Commission deems appropriate to make available to Kosovo macro-financial assistance in the form of grants of around EUR 50 million.
The Community has already found it an appropriate measure to help ease Kosovo's financial constraints in exceptionally difficult circumstances and, under Council Decisions 2000/140/EC and 2001/511/EC, provided exceptional financial assistance in the form of straight grants amounting to EUR 35 million and EUR 30 million in 2000 and 2001 respectively.
The last payment under such assistance was released in December 2002. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Decision 2000/140/EC of 14 February 2000 providing exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo[1].
Council Decision 2001/511/EC of 27 June 2001 providing exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo[2]. | 140 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Kosovo is integrated in the bilateral framework of EU relations with the Western Balkans.
In the European Partnership for Kosovo adopted in December 2005, the Council identified key short term and medium term priorities for Kosovo, as regards economic policy very much in line with IMF priorities as well.
The latest Progress Report on Kosovo[3] was published by the Commission in November 2005 and notably reported on developments of the political situation and relations between the EU and Kosovo.
The foreseen exceptional financial assistance complements the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme which since 2001 has been the main EC financial instrument for co-operation for the Western Balkan countries, and for Kosovo in particular.
The EC annual CARDS assistance programme allocated to Kosovo amounted to EUR 65.28 million in 2003, EUR 74.5 million in 2004 and EUR 79 million in 2005.
Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be duly taken into account. | 310 | Legal basis Article 308 of the EC Treaty | 329 | Subsidiarity principle While Member States may provide bilateral macro-financial assistance, a Community macro-financial assistance grouping the efforts of all Member States is a simpler and more efficient economic and financial instrument. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | 331 | The assistance will be fully consistent with the macroeconomic targets already set in the LOI and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the IMF and signed in November 2005, or any subsequent arrangements or understandings reached with the IMF.
As regards specific conditions attached to the disbursement of the grant instalments, the Commission intends to focus on a limited number of areas, including in particular public finance management. | 332 | While bilateral donors will be encouraged to provide complementary support either through budget or project support, the exact burden sharing with bilateral donors cannot at this stage be assessed and will be linked to the broader context of a full-fledged donors support exercise expected to take place upon status resolution. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instruments: other. | 342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason: In the absence of a framework regulation for the macro-financial assistance instrument, ad hoc Council decisions under Article 308 of the Treaty are the only available legal instrument for this assistance. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 401 | Such assistance would be financed from commitment appropriations in 2006 under budget line 01 03 02 02 (Macro-financial assistance to the Western Balkans).

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 1244 (1999) on 10 June 1999 aiming at promoting the establishment, pending a final settlement, of substantial autonomy and self-government in Kosovo within the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 3.
On 24 October 2005, the UN Security Council approved the UN Secretary General’s proposal to launch the political process to determine the future status of Kosovo. 6.
Within the Stabilisation and Association process, which is the framework for EU relations with the region, it is desirable to support efforts to sustain political and economic stabilisation in Kosovo, with a view to evolving towards the development of a full cooperation relationship with the Community making the European future of Kosovo more tangible. 8.
The Community has already found it an appropriate measure to help ease Kosovo's financial constraints in exceptionally difficult circumstances and, under Council Decision 2000/140/EC of 14 February 2000 providing exceptional Community assistance to Kosovo[6] and Council Decision 2001/511/EC of 27 June 2001 on further exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo[7], provided exceptional financial assistance in the form of straight grants amounting to EUR 35 million and EUR 30 million in 2000 and 2001 respectively.
The last payment under such assistance was released in December 2002. 9.
The framework identifies budget and off-budget financing needs in 2006-2008.
Accordingly, it is estimated that budget external financial assistance of some EUR 81 million -respectively EUR 14 million in 2006 and EUR 67 million in 2007- would be needed until the end of 2007. 10.
The release of this grant assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the Budgetary authority. 14.
The Community shall make available to Kosovo an exceptional financial assistance in the form of a grant of up to EUR 50 million with a view to alleviating the financial situation in Kosovo, supporting the development of a sound economic and fiscal framework, facilitating the continuation and strengthening of essential administrative functions and addressing public investment needs. 19.
