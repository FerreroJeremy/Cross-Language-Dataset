Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3], Whereas: (1) In the Community there is a need for improved energy end-use efficiency, managed demand for energy and promotion of the production of renewable energy, as there is relatively limited scope for any other influence on energy supply and distribution conditions in the short to medium term, either through the building of new capacity or through the improvement of transmission and distribution.
Human activities attributed to the energy sector cause as much as 78 % of the Community greenhouse gas emissions.
This liberalisation has not led to significant competition in products and services which could have resulted in improved energy efficiency on the demand side. (10) In its Resolution of 7 December 1998 on energy efficiency in the European Community [10], the Council endorsed a target for the Community as a whole to improve energy intensity of final consumption by an additional one percentage point per annum up to the year 2010. (11) Member States should therefore adopt national indicative targets to promote energy end‐use efficiency and to ensure the continued growth and viability of the market for energy services, and thus contribute to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Therefore, even though Member States commit themselves to making efforts to achieve the target figure of 9 %, the national energy savings target is indicative in nature and entails no legally enforceable obligation for Member States to achieve it. (13) In aiming to achieve their national indicative target, Member States may set themselves a target higher than 9 %. (14) The improvement of energy efficiency will benefit from an exchange of information, experience and best practice at all levels, including, in particular, the public sector.
The creation of funds to subsidise the implementation of energy efficiency programmes and other energy efficiency improvement measures and to promote the development of a market for energy services can constitute an appropriate tool for the provision of non-discriminatory start-up funding in such a market. (17) Improved energy end-use efficiency can be achieved by increasing the availability of and demand for energy services or by other energy efficiency improvement measures. (18) In order to realise the energy savings potential in certain market segments where energy audits are generally not sold commercially, such as households, Member States should ensure the availability of energy audits. (19) The Council Conclusions of 5 December 2000 list the promotion of energy services through the development of a Community strategy as a priority area for action to improve energy efficiency. (20) Energy distributors, distribution system operators and retail energy sales companies can improve energy efficiency in the Community if the energy services they market include efficient end-use, such as indoor thermal comfort, domestic hot water, refrigeration, product manufacturing, illumination and motive power.
Article 2 Scope This Directive shall apply to: (a) providers of energy efficiency improvement measures, energy distributors, distribution system operators and retail energy sales companies.
However, Member States may exclude small distributors, small distribution system operators and small retail energy sales companies from the application of Articles 6 and 13; (b) final customers.
Article 3 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: (a) "energy": all forms of commercially available energy, including electricity, natural gas (including liquefied natural gas), liquefied petroleum gas, any fuel for heating and cooling (including district heating and cooling), coal and lignite, peat, transport fuels (excluding aviation and maritime bunker fuels) and biomass as defined in Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market [14]; (b) "energy efficiency": a ratio between an output of performance, service, goods or energy, and an input of energy; (c) "energy efficiency improvement": an increase in energy end-use efficiency as a result of technological, behavioural and/or economic changes; (d) "energy savings": an amount of saved energy determined by measuring and/or estimating consumption before and after implementation of one or more energy efficiency improvement measures, whilst ensuring normalisation for external conditions that affect energy consumption; (e) "energy service": the physical benefit, utility or good derived from a combination of energy with energy efficient technology and/or with action, which may include the operations, maintenance and control necessary to deliver the service, which is delivered on the basis of a contract and in normal circumstances has proven to lead to verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement and/or primary energy savings; (f) "energy efficiency mechanisms": general instruments used by governments or government bodies to create a supportive framework or incentives for market actors to provide and purchase energy services and other energy efficiency improvement measures; (g) "energy efficiency improvement programmes": activities that focus on groups of final customers and that normally lead to verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement; (h) "energy efficiency improvement measures": all actions that normally lead to verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement; (i) "energy service company" (ESCO): a natural or legal person that delivers energy services and/or other energy efficiency improvement measures in a user's facility or premises, and accepts some degree of financial risk in so doing.

[4] For savings in kWh electricity Member States may apply a default co-efficient of 2,5 reflecting the estimated 40 % average EU generation efficiency during the target period.
Bottom-up calculations A bottom-up calculation method means that energy savings obtained through the implementation of a specific energy efficiency improvement measure are measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), in Joules (J) or in kilogram oil equivalent (kgoe) and added to energy savings results from other specific energy efficiency improvement measures.
This model shall cover a level between 20 and 30 % of the annual final inland energy consumption for sectors falling within the scope of this Directive, subject to due consideration of the factors referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) below.
In developing this harmonised bottom-up model in accordance with Article 15(2), the Committee shall aim to use standardised methods which entail a minimum of administrative burden and cost, notably by using the measurement methods referred to in points 2.1 and 2.2 and by focusing on those sectors where the harmonised bottom-up model can be most cost efficiently applied.
Some top-down calculations will be necessary to measure the impact of measures implemented after 1995 (and in certain cases as early as 1991) that continue to have impact. 1.2.
The findings should be compared to a control group (non-participation group) if possible or, alternatively, normalised as described in point 1.2.
The Commission, assisted by the Committee established under Article 16, shall therefore replace the above list with an agreed preliminary list of the average lifetime of different energy efficiency improvement measures not later than 17 November 2006. 5.
The appropriate Member State authorities or agencies referred to in Article 4(4) may provide further instructions on this matter.
