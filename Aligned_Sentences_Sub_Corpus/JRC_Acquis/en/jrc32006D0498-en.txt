A report published by the United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry in February 1997 entitled "European research — accidents caused by children under five playing with cigarette lighters and matches" estimated a total of about 1200 fires, 260 injuries and 20 deaths per year in the EU for 1997.
It is therefore necessary to resort to a Decision according to Article 13 of Directive 2001/95/EC. (13) In view of the serious risk from lighters and in order to ensure a consistent high level of consumer health and safety protection throughout the EU as well as to avoid barriers to trade, a temporary Decision in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2001/95/EC should be adopted.
A US study of 1987, "Harwood’s study", demonstrated that on average 96 % of the accidents caused by children playing with lighters were due to disposable lighters.
Lighter producers should provide on request without delay to the competent authorities established under Article 6 of the Directive 2001/95/EC all the documents needed.
Lighters for which producers and distributors do not provide the documentation mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 above within the deadline fixed by the competent authorities, shall be withdrawn from the market.
Reports of a child-resistance test referred to in Article 3 shall include in particular: (a) the name, address and principal place of business of the manufacturer wherever he is located, and of the importer if the lighters are imported; (b) a complete description of the lighter, including size, shape, weight, fuel, fuel capacity, ignition mechanism, and child-resistance devices, design, technical solutions and other features that make the lighter child-resistant in accordance with the definitions and requirements of this Decision.
Reports of a child-resistance test referred to in Article 3 shall be established by either: (a) testing bodies accredited as fulfilling the requirements established by EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 "General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories", by a member of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for executing child-resistance tests on lighters or otherwise recognised to that end by the competent authority of a Member State; (b) testing bodies whose reports of a child-resistance test are accepted by one of the countries where child-resistance requirements equivalent to those established by this Decision are applied.
Article 5 The prohibition referred to in Article 13(3) of Directive 2001/95/EC shall not apply.
Within the framework of activities referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety the Commission will, in advance of the deadline for the implementation of this Decision by the Member States, establish guidelines with the aim of facilitating the practical application of the Decision.
Article 7 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
