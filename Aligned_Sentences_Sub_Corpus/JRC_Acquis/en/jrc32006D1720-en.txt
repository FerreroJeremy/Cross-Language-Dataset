The teaching and learning of languages is of special relevance among neighbouring Member States. (18) The interim evaluation reports of the existing Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes and the public consultation on the future of Community activity in education and training revealed a strong and in some respects growing need for continuing cooperation and mobility in these fields at European level.
Hitherto, however, participation by such enterprises in the Leonardo da Vinci programme has been limited.
Suitable arrangements, similar to those that exist under the Erasmus programme, should be made for the recognition of the outcomes of such mobility. (28) Given the particular educational challenges facing the children of occupational travellers and mobile workers in Europe, full use should be made of the opportunities available under the Comenius programme to support transnational activities targeted at their needs. (29) Increased mobility throughout Europe should be accompanied by constantly higher standards. (30) In order to respond to the increased need to support activities at European level designed to achieve these policy objectives, to provide a means of supporting trans-sectoral activity in the fields of languages and ICT, and to strengthen the dissemination and exploitation of results of the programme, it is appropriate to complement the four sectoral sub-programmes with a transversal programme. (31) In order to respond to the increasing need for knowledge and dialogue on the European integration process and its development, it is important to stimulate excellence in teaching, research and reflection in this field by supporting higher education institutions specialising in the study of the European integration process, European associations in the fields of education and training and the Jean Monnet Action. (32) It is necessary to provide sufficient flexibility in the formulation of this Decision to allow for appropriate adjustments in the actions of the Lifelong Learning Programme to respond to changing needs during the period from 2007 to 2013, and to avoid the inappropriately detailed provisions of previous phases of Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes. (33) In all its activities, the Community is to aim to eliminate inequalities and promote equality between men and women, as provided for in Article 3(2) of the Treaty. (34) Further to Article 151 of the Treaty, the Community is to take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures.
Intercultural dialogue should also be encouraged. (35) There is a need to promote active citizenship and respect for human rights and democracy, and to step up the fight against exclusion in all its forms, including racism and xenophobia. (36) There is a need to widen access for those from disadvantaged groups and to address actively the special learning needs of those with disabilities, in the implementation of all parts of the programme, including through the use of higher grants to reflect the additional costs of disabled participants, and the provision of support for the learning and use of sign languages and Braille. (37) Note should be taken of the achievements of the European Year of Education through Sport (2004) and of the potential educational benefits of cooperation between educational institutions and sports organisations that the Year highlighted. (38) The candidate countries for accession to the European Union and the EFTA countries which are members of the EEA may participate in Community programmes in accordance with agreements to be signed between the Community and these countries. (39) The Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 approved the Council conclusions of 16 June 2003 on the Western Balkans, including the Annex thereto entitled %quot%The Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans: moving towards European integration%quot%, which provides that Community programmes should be opened to the Stabilisation and Association Process countries on the basis of framework agreements to be signed between the Community and those countries. (40) The Community and the Swiss Confederation have declared their intention of undertaking negotiations to conclude agreements in areas of common interest such as Community education, training and youth programmes. (41) The Lifelong Learning Programme should be regularly monitored and evaluated in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in order to allow for readjustments, particularly with respect to the priorities for implementing the measures.
This Decision shall be implemented over the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
