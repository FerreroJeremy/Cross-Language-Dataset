On the first councilman who is responsible is the use of real Lieutenant, to whose house the council goes at noon, and accompany him to the council house, where he delivered logo real lieutenant, a tall pole has a shield over the fist-sized silver hand, which are carved the royal arms.
Real Ensign accompanied by a little Indian which serves as a page, and takes the baton when he wears the royal standard.
The next day we repeated the ride, and sing the Mass and Vespers the evening before, and noon real reserves the banner, but the real picture remains discovered all the day, occupied in running in the square, dancing, ring in the evening and other entertainment.
In the same way that continues the next day, which usually take some bulls Cut the blades to not hurt the fighters, which are very clumsy and adventurous.
In some representing peoples operas or comedies truncated nights, but as representatives are Indians, and most of them boys, and do not understand what they say and can not pronounce While the Castilian, are poorly understood and have little grace these representations for Spanish and for them.
At noon join the tables in the square for the blessing in this way, regular pass this day twenty tables which are arranged, and some rich people even reach percent, and all very rich meat, cheaper for the people must spend this day at least 50 bulls, because of the neighboring villages attends many people, and all provide food in abundance.
In those days it was divided, while the dances, bull ring, and several trifles of who work in towns, such as beads, cups, spoons, combs and canvas blade cotton, are also given, if there in the store, needles, tape, knives and other trifles they believe a lot.
Of this, some things are given as a reward to those who dance or carry ring, and others were thrown in the catch, which is what they have more fun, and together to catch them all, even the lobbyists, if something falls to where they are sitting forget the formality with which they are cast as children and to take what they can, although in the day contain something.

Although the custom in their distributions go to know the date and time of all are so used to not do anything without it sent, to await the signal for all drum, or voice of the preacher or publisher, and so all day we hear repeated touches and post boxes in the streets what they should do.
At dawn, after the bell makes signal under the drums and the streets are divided by some Indians, who were loud stand up to say praise God, to get ready to go to church to hear mass, then the work, and thus the will of God will be provided the support and please their higher.
At all hours of the day repeating the same diligence as they have to do, the same to come to the rosary, however, that the bell tells them.
Though I noticed that in several hours of the night played the boxes, particularly the morning, curiosity prompted me to ask what purpose were those touches, and I responded I always had this habit of remembering all the people in a few hours of night, and that's why they were doing.
Hastening over this matter and its origin, I was told that the Jesuits, knowing the lazy genius of the Indians, and, tired of working all day, then who came home and dined, they slept until the next day, at dawn they were up to go to church and then to work, and not reached their wives husbands long time, and decreased the population, and arranged so that in some hours of the night, remember to comply with the obligation of marriage.

From kids raise them so cramped that if they send for some, but I have to view, do not know raise your voice to call, and go where it is and tell you there call, nor usually not allowed to touch them in their homes guitars or other instrument, and less home having dances, on the day are allowed, but with many limitations.

Since I have told you what I found most peculiar to this province and its natural I argue it will not be disagreeable to you, before going on to try other things, talked to you something of the Indian nations infidels, confining to these peoples, as well as they may eventually increase the province, and because their news may be fuller concept of all this, and what then intends for the purpose of improvement.
Under Guyana's nomination include these natives to many other nations, who have some relationship to each other, and whose genius, customs and language differ little, this is like the Guarani, and probably has the same origin, and, although altered and disfigured with a different accent and pronunciation, with little difficulty understanding the Indians of these towns.
The nation Guyana, together with other nations their peers, is quite large, living on either side of the Parana, from about 20 miles from Corpus Christi to the Salto Grande Paraná and even higher, ranging up to about Uruguay, Iguazu River, St.
Its natural docilísimo, and so friendly with the Indians of these towns no news I have made the slightest damage to the frequent trips that make yerba mate; rather help them to work, look and show the places where many trees grass and even their assistance with food when they scarce, contenting himself with some trifles they are given, such as beads, mirrors, some girls and some axes cotton canvas.
These Indians live scattered in the mountains, feeding on the hunt, kill with arrows without poison, not used or known to eat any bugs, but their main food is the honey from the mountains.
Also plant some fields, but not cultivated; what they do is pour the seed in some place, and while they think will result and turn around and collect what they find, the seeds you have are: beans of several species and some bear fruit all year until the cold consume the plants, corn and pumpkins or pumpkins of various species, some of exquisite taste.
Twelve miles from the town of Corpus, to the east, a small reduction Guyana nation, named San Francisco de Paula, who is in charge of the Dominicans; and although many years ago it was founded, or is increased, and there is hope to remain with fruit, for though the Indians manifest inclination to be Christians, there are many impediments that make it difficult to achieve the set them civil and Christian life.
The number of Christians that make up this reduction is about 50, including young and old, but they do not always assist in the reduction, therefore, accustomed to seeking their food in the mountains, they come for them to ensure, where they try and talk with relatives and friends the infidels, estándose with them many months, resulting which may not return to the reduction.
Unbelievers also frequent it often, particularly reduced when they eat, then filled the reduction of infidels, and consuming what needs to retire, taking with them many of the Christians, or fans treatment, or forced of necessity, go with them.
The site is located where the reduction is one of the greatest difficulties is to is increased, the proximity and deal with their own will not let them forget their old ways and inclinations, the little forest bare ground does not allow them to extend their farms, let alone raising animals, since, besides the lack of land, so abundant mosquito flies and gnats of various species, which may even have a horse for the service of doctrinaire religious.
In October of last year, 1784, while the illustrious Don Fray Luis de Velasco, bishop of the city of Paraguay, visited the people of his diocese, Corpus being in the Guiana Indians declined to confirm Christians in that town.
On this occasion had the opportunity this illustrious gentleman, and had me talk to them, and particularly with the mayor, that although Guyana nation was born and raised in the people of Corpus, and asking for the reasons that motivated seemed to him the little overtaking of decline, said the shortness of their land and immediacy to the mountains, where were necessary for food, along with not being accustomed to work, were the reasons for the reduction distracted by the low, and the infidels, although all wanted to be Christians, seeing that they had nothing to eat in the reduction, would not come to it, and only come around when they know there to eat, and in turn consuming to the mountains, and only give them good land elsewhere would be achieved increasing reduction.
To which I said the bishop to speak to relatives and friends and persuaded them to come out from the mountains, that the King would grant them mercy land and how to survive in other places with the amenities of that seen in people, and provide for their ministers that the doctrine and teaching the way of Heaven, and diligence that brought to the execution after they returned to the reduction, and their I tell my result, for me to participate to the bishop and his excellency Viceroy to the report had it convenient, and although it stayed in, particularly the sheriff, so far nothing has resulted or will result as I tell you.
In the time that the people of Candelaria was covered in my office, had prepared Indians those frequent trips to the wild yerba mate, and among other things and mandated to be controllable in this task was one which retains the best harmony with unbelievers, fans deal with them, and always they had a chance Christians to lure them out of the mountains and, welcome everybody to conveniences they had in their villages, and they were patents, see if they could persuade some chiefs that, as a walk, come and see his people, and indeed one with wine two other Indians with some of Candelaria, who entertained and gave a lot.
And treating them the issue of conversion and reduction, and they replied that they, like everyone else of those mountains, they wanted to be Christians, but were there to teach them religious, because they could not get out, because if they came to the villages had to die, and of this persuasion, that gave no reason, I could not deter
