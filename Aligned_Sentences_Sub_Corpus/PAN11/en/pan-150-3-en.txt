The Spain General-consuming almost unique in that article, provided to the Philippine Islands the advantages of a large branch of commerce, to navigation a merchant and exercise capacity profit, the nation's treasury and considerable savings for the amounts that go to the abroad, and to consumers' satisfaction in order to improve their inclinations, because there will never be convinced that a snuff pure, soft and aromatic, like the Philippines, recognized so by all nations who have liked, ceases to be preferred in Spain, which generals is consumed abroad, that hardly can take it to another party if the jeneraliza Manila.
Chinese, Malayalam, Malay, prefer the use of snuff for their crops, resembling each detestable the snuff of others.
In Spain there is no harvest, the taste has been shaped by custom and need, and by these means can be varied and even improved, it is clear that the snuff of Manila, as exceding plant in good quality to many of his class, and everything else is fancy, illusion or prevention.
All markets of Spain and some of other European nations were reluctant at first to sugar in the Philippines by the novelty of their smell and their grain, and then the knowledge that their essential advantages outweigh its accidental qualities have made him a General-use and desired, and is on day one of the main fruit in their wealth.
The snuff in the Philippines grows everywhere, and the production of this branch of agriculture is indefinitely, and at lower prices than those harvested in other countries.
Navigation, although long, is well known and coveted by trade.
Freight charges can not exceding weighing per arroba, which is evidenced by the pipes made up here, so are naturally established the elements of a great branch of trade between the Philippines and Spain without notice on this point the need for further caution that the road Manila snuff is precisely driven into leaded and sealed boxes, and is transported tea from China, in order that their flavor does not dissipate or decrease your strength, as is that of Havana and others in the navigation.
Esponse everything on this income, reforms and bases for promotion, agriculture Trade and the Government should adopt, it seems are like most appropriate: 1a, which extends the monopoly of snuff in the Philippines to all provinces excluded in without any exception, using the means that government leniency with soft and that made the conquest and acquisition of those lands, and never, or very rare case, the authority or force, but arrived this case, with all do respect its provisions Enerji and mandates. 2nd That the identification and capacity of the leaf buying to rent growers, is made to a board appointed annually by employees of the capital of the most trusted INTELLIGENCE é in the field, with assistance from the mayor of the province, before the faith of a notary public, if any, and if not, is elijirá person extends to the case and authorize the dilijencias board, concluding the ceremony, you should burn at once to the same board all the snuff that would have been futile.
All this, as that practiced on guaranteeing the smooth use of the interest income would destroy any hidden handling that might be detrimental, and formalities prescribed would give some importance to act very necessary and proper for which corresponds to compliance with public funds. 3.a last.
That contracts of chartering of vessels, as has been established, but vessels Spanish, renewed annually, is brought to Spain all that is needed to snuff the Peninsula consumption, paid with the amount of the collection of branches of finance for referral annual surplus to Spain and boxes of Manila, and by removing the dilapidated system of warrants.
So set the plan, consideration would be of great profits that the nation would take annually in this sector, and not less bulk and importance to promoting agriculture would receive and trade in the Philippines, and more authority than they can describe the assistance that Asian-Spanish provinces contribute to public funds because, besides the sary contribution we pay to the stranger for his snuff of Kentuqui and Virjinia; shocking thing and even shocking, as we are by a foreign tax on an item which our overseas provinces can supply the world with better and more comfort Jenera price; and yet that Providence and the bravery and courage Spanish owners gave us three centuries of these mines has snuff, until today we still tax the foreigner for this production, because it is not known, or not wanted to take the match to be of our own production.
Much more could be added in this area, but just right for timely reminder of So in this part for us and we need to do, because serious superfluous, even annoying, stopping to show things that are at this point well within reach of everyone. §.
INCOME OF WINE.
The products of this income can never get to be in the Philippines from the consideration that those of snuff, for the Indians (only consumers of wine stagnant) are very sober beverages, because even not known in all its extent the vice of drunkenness.
The coconut and nipa wine, only stagnant, are healthy for the Indians, because the tobacco regularized sets of peoples, has perfected the preparation of liquor, and has moderate its strength, making it more pleasant and helpful, and so the Indians in General-want more the monopoly that the freedom of this article.
The lack of increase in this income mainly depends not be spread abroad through all the provinces of the islands, as it should be, to match the condition of natural destroy the contraband, and avoid hereby make other drinks harmful to your health, according to happens to the rom or rum, sugar or honey, and other brew mistelas making unhealthy.
This idea spread abroad the monopoly of this income for all provinces perhaps alarmed many who are familiar with the practical character of the Indians, and seeing each reform a useful and necessary evils Jerman of stories that presents their timid exaggeration spirit, influence, engage and work always to raise barriers and building resilience, spans more by fear than by reason, not to make progress in the way of improvements.
A these weak spirits only reply to his visions, and for compelling reasons in support my doctrine, suffice it to say that not many years ago it spread the monopoly of this income to the provinces of Camarines and Albay, and planned and established without opposition or resistance some, and rent increased revenues with provinces such products are, and that before were not so tight, that does so as soon settled in these provinces without use of force, without violence and without any Jenera of oppression, it is very easy to establish this tight in all the other free, the only way that this progress and increase income yields.
But instead of engaging in such an important issue, and provide income to the expanse that must be for promotion, not long ago the reloaded with new employees and salaries, rising to a rank in expenses that he never had, and still did not need the possessed.
Not content even with this, in 1839 approved the creation and establishment of a subordinate administration, entitled Town of Manila, endowing it with an administrator with a thousand dollars of annual salary a controller with six hundred, and I know that but, when the system of income from Orijen or has required the administration subordinate or expenditures, and may well continue without one or the other, what it is, and encouraged no such increase jobs and wages.
I have not seen or accurate news of the bases that would prevail in forming this expedient increase of employees and creation of the subaltern, who finally passed, but I doubt that report consideration to the benefits of rent, and I think more useful than either of lien, so what persuade the manager to know that Gen.
Pablo Fernandez Alonso served in her many years without senior employees who are now generals office, the established and perfected, lead to a range of splendor for the products they yield, which is easy to know collating how the income received and how he handed to his successor.
Data to come to the attention of this truth the secretary of finance, must exist, and with them will view it it was income and what it is today, which spent before and what is now spent, and such news nothing easier than starting with a reform that the best way to ensure the administration, make the economies to be fair and avoid hand extends easily to new creation of offices and employees increased, until the expanse to be acquired income, the demand to equip the new units to be set, if you want that the income of wine became what can and should be in one province that is well look, and that is not established, it will resist the establishment, if done by wise and gentle ways well known in the Philippines. §.
OFFICE OF THE TREASURY IN PARTICULAR.
Titled office treasury and accounting general of army and government finances, the first Islands, the court and hearing more accounts or accounting, the Quartermaster General- General-Army and local deputy superintendent of public finances, income from snuff and wine, customs, postal and higher government secretariat, but deserved to be treated each one in a separate paragraph all in a balloon is brought into this place, because in all there are only a vice that fight, namely, the excess number of employee owners, escedentes, supernumerary & C., that is in them all, and the need for clean, which reduces to the purely accurate, useful and necessary, download the public treasury as salary, pension and annuities ought not to pay, because if twenty good employees can be covered service, Why it has to maintain state or two hundred?
This and only this is the reform plan These offices need, the blame for this abuse of this disorder, and even if you want of this evil, it is not the wretched suitors obtaron and got these loans, but the government, who should have known enough for him twenty employees, for example, he named to hundreds, no account and reason, providing Temporary and future against the law expresses Pig [21], taxing and damaging one treasury, and not putting all the dedication and zeal in administering which had to.
Notwithstanding the balloon that all offices in order to express only are provided with a profusion of employees, I also try, but quickly, for the some in particular, because there is a flaw, should be reported and obtain remedy.
In court and audience analysis, or accounting is greater if the increase of hands has received since my absence has not caught up business, I do not know when get this, it is not the fault of the employees, but the debtors of the estate, dedicated to hinder and delay the payment of what is owed by every means within his reach: so is that there is a regular trial expedients of accounts that have many years of acting, but for unusual transactions, unknown, and therefore illegal, as that are intended only to delay paying what they owe, with injury and damage to the treasury, as the Government must know the relationships that the chief accountant shall report State trials of the day, with expression of what is owed, which has claimed, and what still remains to duty, the dilijencias ratio for all practiced.
The Real disposition, as worthy to be taken to the eye, and very conducive to the reforms should be done, as they continue the same or greater abuses, will go back to end, marked with number 2, having a bit of it happened in my papers.
The offices of the superintendent of public finances, well-regarded occupations and tasks, and that the captain generals, as governor, has a secretary and a secretariat could send those, it would be very useful and helpful to suppress and save their salaries, and recast in the offices of government, exercising the functions of General-Superintendent Captain subdelegado generals, as it was for many years, having established the esperiencia the reunion of all superior authority in the first to send weapons, it is advantageous for those countries, it is known that the more you divide and share the authority is less powerful, is less prestijio and moral force, and therefore as less powerful, less respected, and more esponse to slights, that however small, defile the character of top officials of a state.
Moreover, this would provide economies are also of considerable bulk and weight to the effect of this reform.
Speaking of the income of snuff and wine, and noted that abound of employees, so only remains to indicate that the first only elaboratorios and storage must be increased to manufacture and maintain as it could work and have always plentiful assortments of all but not only to remit to the Peninsula, but to sell abroad, and meet hiciese few trade orders for Sport, as an article of trade can also be useful as indicated.
This would occupy many families, and would facilitate their livelihoods; besides the very helpful and useful to the national treasury, which would undoubtedly increase their income.
In the office had much to say, but leave it to silence by not incurring any inaccuracies because of this facility is an interested party that can and should promote useful reforms that created you agree.
Manila trade confidentially complained many the delay times experienced by businesses and other damages by the method undergoes with which they are mounted that customs offices, where from dawn to dusk, without exception of holidays and public holidays should be constantly running the office, but above all trade is who should represent and seek to remove obstacles that may impair, and raising the progress of reforms to suit their needs.
Ultimately, it is noted and known that in every office there is a growing and even exorbitant number of Indians who have endowment clerks from four to twelve dollars each month; class I would deem prudent to delete, then all employees should know that it is to deal As he put his trust and care, and write it and without regard servants demands the negotiated allocation.
Only the heads should each have a clerk vantage to copy their work properly, but that all tables have one, and some two parking clerks, and also, as in an office, has tables that can Generals call for papers, gather as six, eight and even more to copy, as table School is not only shocking, but cumbersome and disruptive, for the sums that their salaries absorb.
The Indians engaged in tasks best in its class, as many arms would be useful to industry and agriculture in the Islands, which would provide more useful services to the state, not in the miserable idleness in which they live, the low wage slaves enjoyed.
On post office and has said that the exponent with another co-deputation made several reflections for directing an exposition to the throne by reason of having come to understand reform burdensome that this income was introduced, and approved a main office in a bright and expensive over scarce goods and purely temporary, as will proven by these observations, as mentioned, will in the final copy, marked with number. 1st Anything more would stretch it out on the case, but not daring to venture anything without data accurate, I fail to extend my thoughts on the subject, to avoid which are then interpreted of sinister, daughters of bad faith, or at least a gross ignorance, when precisely this case, without seeing the expedient which was the approval of the office bright and even without using previously practiced, could not presentárseme easiest thing to ride the establishment of a so without burdening the exchequer, would be useful to dependents debian deal on it, but this is not of this place or my incunvencia, the Government plays consider the plant with and known their services, reforming the most economical and fair way
