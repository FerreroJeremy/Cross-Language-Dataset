Which, as hobiese released their four captains in the way you have already heard, and had [16] great desire for him to go and hold the Cuzco and the Inca Viracocha, taking other third share of people who left, leaving his land and people with the collection and keep necessary so that if any of it will prompt you to come back in their care and shelter, - and so he, already done this and provided, broke with its people and taking their two captains in é looking Viracocha demand.
Which was very still that anxiety, because he not at war against anyone or tried to take or remove any one for him.
And still ANSI standard of this war that came upon him, came to him two messengers who invia Uscovilca, by which we mean that winters give obedience, as unto the Lord it was, where not, to gear, nickel was going to make war, and I thought dalle battle é sujetalle, let him know Quél Vilcacunga was in, which is seven miles from the city of Cuzco, and it would be rather short with him.
And saw the Inca Viracocha of an embassy that Uscovilca he sent him, and who brought great power, and everything left behind was subject to him, inviolable say he was happy to give him obidient, and I wanted to eat and drink with him.
Then went they were the messengers of the city of Cuzco with the embassy of Viracocha Inca, made raise its key and entered into his agreement to see what to do, because they were as brief Uscovilca couriers, who did not give rise to that with his apparently take in what was to respond, and so they responded to what you heard, and then came [17] and being it considered that Uscovilca came with great power of people, and leave proud and which ANSI giving it so easily, that would be lightly esteemed, and agreed to with the best chapter the things they were doing to their preservation, but there are still subjective and therefore would not easily as if they would give, - to be out of this city of Cuzco, Viracocha with all city ??people, and most of their neighbors who wished to follow, go to a Penol quest seven leagues from this city of Cuzco, on top of a village called Traces, which Penol strong Xahuana Xaqui called Caca [18].
About this time Inca Viracocha had seven children, had one of these least of all, which Inca Yupanqui was called, and at that time that Viracocha Inca Cuzco wanted out of this his son Inca Yupanqui, though minor, was a youth of great presumption and a man who had much his person, and it ill that his father Viracocha Inca to the desmamparar its people and want to give subjetacion as well as we had promised, it seemed that it was bad case and great shame for the people that they had desto news, and seeing his orchestra agreed father and the other lords of Cuzco is out, itself presupposed not to leave him and join the people who could, and since Uscovilca came, he did not give such obidient, but die before to say who lived in subjection, and that could bring together so many people happiness and good fortune be such that the Uscovilca expires, and so they were liberating their people.
And assuming that ANSI had thought, and went in search of three young men, sons of gentlemen and his friends, and children of those men with whom his father had entered into consultation it out and give obedience to the Chanca, - the names of whom were young men, one Vica Quirao [19] and the other Apo Mayta, and the other Quilescachi Urco Guaranga; - and joining Inca Yupanqui with these three young men gentlemen, consulted with them what I had thought, and said that before was due to assume and be glad to receive him in death, not living in such subjection and infamy, not having been born subjective.
And while all four ANSI time, the young men rejoiced Inca Yupanqui to tell them that, é gave him what word to him to do, and being all four of a review and Paresce, Viracocha Inca and the city went out for Penol bringing the people of Cuzco, and most of their neighbors who could carry.
Inca Yupanqui and the three youths and those gentlemen, they stayed in the city with each path servants wanted to stay with them, which is called Pata raised Yupanqui, and Muru UAnC [20] and Apo Yupanqui, Uxuta Urco Guaranga, which were alone, was not with them other most outstanding person of his servants.
For as the Uscovilca hobiese known that Viracocha had been run away from the city of Cuzco, and brought with him all his people, and the most that could lead from other neighboring villages to the city of Cuzco, had this Uscovilca that would turn him no part of the Inca Yupanqui, who was to resist the power that he brought.
And heard their embassy and response got out of Cuzco, and went to his Lord Uscovilca, who was at that time rejoiced with the gentlemen who brought them there in the seat Vilcacunga, and hearing by the response Uscovilca Inca Yupanqui that he winters with his messenger, della rejoiced, because I thought success of Cuzco as I have heard.
The changa [21] entered into its agreement with the three gentlemen who had them, and agreed to Send It Viracocha a messenger to his father, which winters will say, that looked disgrace he came and Cuzco had never been subjective since I had Mango Capac village; parescia him, if he Paresce, who must defend their city, and not allow Se say that such a thing hobiese desmanparado his people, and then be given and surrender his enemies, who came to his city, he promised, as his son was dying front of him, if he craves to return, and defendella for budget had died Quél rather than of will say that he had left subjet being freed Mr.
And heard for Viracocha Inca your child what invia to say, she laughed much of an embassy and said: "As a man I communicate and talk to God and known by him have been advised that I am not part Uscovilca to resist, and being ANSI warned I got out of Cuzco to better able to order what I do dishonor Uscovilca and mine to mistreatment, and that boy Inca Yupanqui want to die and I presume that been wrongly decided?
I turn and decilde river of his youth, and that he and his men come I get it, and if they want to do, which I regret, because my son and want to die development way. "The messenger answered with these words he was saying Viracocha Inca, that his master budget had that, and that in no way left to die or conquer it and those with he was before coming into subjection.
And to this he replied Inca Viracocha, which return, and that it was the opinion of his master and his will, which pelease and will make every power, quentendia that it was to be the end of their battle, it would be a prisoner dead boy é and without understanding: and to tell them to their masters, Quel not think to go there and that no so winters will become like an embassy.
And it heard by the messenger, broke your answer to where her master was, and that was reached, told him that his father Viracocha Inca winters will say in response to your message.
All of which is heard by Inca Yupanqui, rescibió Despite this response, because he thought his father would invest some relief, and as they saw their neighbors in the quest villages around the city of Cuzco, his father Viracocha Inca succor him with some help and assistance, for so it would come and would give him such favor the neighbors.
And being so sad he and his family for what you already have heard, it was well parescióle Send It their messengers to the chiefs of the neighboring villages, informing them of the need in quest and how he had invia their messengers to his father, which he had not loved Send It no relief, he begged them with his powers he favoresciesen and people.
And this thought ANSI by Inca Yupanqui, he called those four lads that there had, to those who sent them, and to every one another, to go with the embassy have learned from the chiefs and gentlemen who longs were around the city in the space of three leagues, and remains divided (and) by Inca Yupanqui these messengers, was left alone each to the people and chiefs with the embassy You heard, where, as hobiesen come to the chiefs and gentlemen, do his master winter, and heard by such chiefs embassy and ask them invia Inca Yupanqui, answered them these messengers in this way: "Go back, brothers, and tell your master Inca Yupanqui we call [22] of heart and will, and that he rejoiced in helping us make that calls and succor to our people and power, but, Paresce us that the power of Uscovilca Chanca that about him and comes to us, which is great and very large, and as he [did not] have more people to his person and his companions, and the power they could give and help him ansímismo was little, and could not help, and if it was perhaps those lifeguard tiniendo no more power to him until there he was, it would spoil him and them - because ansímismo obidient they were to give the Chanca, as his father intended to do, whenever and that the Chanca they were requested, which until there had been for the inviolability Chanca to ask for anything, but it [that] they would do with him was, that as he looks from somewhere or by any air had so much power some people, that they were ready ansímismo of help you need and resistance like I wanted to do, which not only he only played, but to them ansimismo, and to every one for himself: and that ansímismo inviarian to the other provinces and towns with each confined [23], to ask for its aid and favor, and with its people and with such aid, who promised he will help and assist each and when those they saw that he had somewhere to put people in such resistance; which thanked him and prayed that craves it did, what they would do what ansimismo said had. "All this heard by courier turned where his master was, to which said the response that you heard.
And heard by Inca Yupanqui, rescibió big penalty by himself alone, and offerings will see that the chiefs were doing it, considering themselves they had together [24] and asked what was right, quel had some people, with which that of such chiefs and help that were made [it together].
And being in this sentence, say it would be about time the sun had set and it grew dark the night, and as it was dark, which said to his companions and his servants to others, who were all there together as they were, é none go out with him, and so they just left the room without taking any other them.
Inca Yupanqui was very virtuous and amiable young man in his conversation, was a man who spoke to be as little boy, é did not laugh too much so, but with great tact, and very friend to do good to the poor, and that was chaste youth, who never heard that hobiese known woman, and she never knew of his time lying and that he should put that thing that no longer meets. É as he had these parts of virtue and gallant gentleman, but boy, and was of great courage, considering his father to the Inca Yupanqui be his son, reigned envy aborresciale it and, because I want an older child of his, who was said Urco Inca, had this being of Inca Yupanqui, and as he saw that this virtue reign in Inca Yupanqui, not consented who might set up in front of him, and gave occasion to that no one knows him that loved him because as he saw that I had such great parties, feared that his days after the lords of Cuzco the other community é hikes you this for that Lord, and that leave to Inca aunquél Urco by as Lord, these gentlemen would deprive Deste state to see it was something simple and that all was not it that capacity and be that Inca Yupanqui, which everyone loved strong will, as we have heard. É as the Inca Viracocha Urco wanted to leave in place after his days, at which might make him the lords of the city of Cuzco and the other people that always respected that made him, and yearns to serve and that will serve him with the lords of Cuzco the real insinias his person were doing, they were, that before the parescia not none, lord it was, nor any of his brothers, with shoes on their feet, but barefoot and heads down the whole time they were talking in front of or to fetch him some some message, he ate alone, no one dared to lay hands on the silver chelated ate, brought in litter and shoulders of lords, if came into the place, sat in the seat of gold had made tyrosol ostrich feather dyed red, drank in golden vessels, and others were ansímismo Service vessels of his house, gold, had many women, of all which was very Ageno Inca Yupanqui, being, as you heard, hated by his father, and have love to Inca Urco.
And so when he saw Inca Viracocha Inca Yupanqui had stayed in the city of Cuzco, dello rejoiced, thinking that would end his days there, and when he sent him to ask for relief You heard, he would not help. É Inca Yupanqui away from their companions the night and history has told you, say he went to do some part any of his seeing him, the space of two deep shots of the city, and that there was in prayer to the Maker of all things, which they call Pachayachachic Viracocha, and Quest in their prayer, which said it this way: "Lord God you made me be a man gave é, help me in this need that I am, as you My Father, and you gave me together and being and as a man, do not let me be killed by my enemies, please give me against them, do not let that I'm biased of them; and as you love me made thee free and only subjective, I'm biased let this people who craves me subjective and want to put in bondage, give me, Lord, Podell power to resist, and beam me thy will, for I am yours. "É when [25] these reasons he said, crying all the decisions heart. É being in his prayer, he fell asleep, being overcome sleep, and Questar in your dream, came to him the figure of Viracocha in man, and he said, "Son, do not grieve, I will send you, the day that thou art to battle your enemies, people with that disrupt and stay victorious. " E Inca Yupanqui then recalled dream Deste serious and wanted amanescer hour, Deste as sleep was gay, took courage, and went to his, and he told them were happy, because he was, and that he had no fear that they would not be vanquished their enemies, Terni is the hobiese people when necessary, and meant them no more, no other things to do, or how, or where, although they questioned him.
And there later, every night away from his teammates and went to the site do their prayers had been done, he always continued to do nothing less than the first time he did, and not for him every night the dream came the first.
But that night the latter end, Questar him in his prayer, that around him Viracocha in figure man, and while awake, and he said, "Son, tomorrow I see us enemies to battle, and I will succor to people, so that disruption and stay victorious. "And the next day morning, Uscovilca say down with his people by Carminga [Carmenca] down, a hill standing on the lowered to the city of Cuzco, going from the city of Los Reyes, and as descended this Uscovilca with all his power and people, who peeked twenty squadrons of people do not view or conosca by Inca Yupanqui and his own, which people looked out the Collasuyo and the path of Asha, and by the way Condesuyo, and how to get these people to do Inca Yupanqui was, which was looking to his companions how he descended to his enemies, and as he reached him that in his favor came, took him in the middle saying, Apu Inca Capac aucaccata atipullac chaymiccanqui China (?) Punchaupi [26], which says: "Come on, just king, and defeat your enemies, now you on this day triples prisoners, "and can not wait they went to the people who came Uscovilca all boil down hills, and finding, locked his battle and fought from morning, which was when they got together, up to half day, and was in such a way the battle, that people died very large amount Uscovilca of people, and none was taken to hand that would not die.
