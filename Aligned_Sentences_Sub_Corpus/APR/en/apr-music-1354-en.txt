morten harket has released two solo albums in norwegian and the english album dangling the long break of 7 years is granted a-ha.
the voice is the same, comparable to no other.
the songs are produced too rock fm for my liking (on this album his norwegian vogt villa is better) but written in tandem with the harvard poet rem.
in brief: a more honest test. "brodsky tune" is a poem by a writer on the bosnian war in former yugoslavia, "east timor" is about the occupation of this region of china, against whom morten has protested with other artists.
my favorite: "spanish steps", "lay me down tonight," "half in love half in hate", "los angeles", "tell me what you see" nothing but rubbish.
