nightwish fan since his debut, i immediately bought the album when tarja is gone, and the least i can say is that this album is very disappointing.
most enthusiasts tarja tell me not to compare when it was in the group, but the facts are there, this album is to my taste a defeat for the solo career of the diva to the thousands of possibilities.
a part may be one or two songs like "i walk alone" or "the reign", the others are disappointing, and tarja capabilities are not at the rendezvous, but it's up to you to make your own opinion ...
