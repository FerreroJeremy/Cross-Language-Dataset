"elemental" is the great unknown of the discography of this group which has marked the late 80's and early 90's.
grandiloquent pop songs, with guitar riffs of smooth, gliding and driving it at once and the singer's voice is truly unique.
there's definitely a tears for fears.
frankly, we say "is not the best" and everything, but we were wrong about the whole line.
it is a very effective album that deserves to be known, then jump on the spot, lovers of good english pop!
these are the fathers of coldplay, keane of which you speak!
