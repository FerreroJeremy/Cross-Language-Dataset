a film "scandal" is it necessarily a masterpiece?
gaspar noe wants to transform us into voyeurs here, and he reached his goal: to make us share his loathing of humans and their pleasure in inflicting pain.
okay, the characters that the actors (also remarkable) embody here are parasites worldly unsympathetic.
or to know what is the meaning of the film.
finally, i've just attended a show sensation (screaming, hard-tech music deafening, dizzying camera movements ...).

no meaning, only extreme sensations available to satisfy the bloodlust of a public accustomed to the hum of the tv. "i want my films to be difficult but exhilarating for the mind," said the author.
however, this film is physically difficult to bear, and it brings to mind that of disgust.
irreversible is the exercise from a former student at the louis lumière school in paris.
too bad, because noah had used to shock films in the genre of social observation, demonstration.
but at the end of irreversible, i felt at having been notching.
