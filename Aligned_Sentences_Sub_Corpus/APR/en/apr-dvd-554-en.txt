the film that described the event as the world of shakespeare, the revolution that would bring a new light on the great playwright, is actually a mash with rose water, where the characters are desperately short of depth.
shakespeare is a bland young man whose plays are barely mentioned, everything revolves rather around a love story a little cutesy, and the genius of man is left completely forgotten.
the parallel between the life of shakespeare and "romeo and juliet" is mediocre and rather "big as a house" ...
the cliches abound, everything is oversimplified.
