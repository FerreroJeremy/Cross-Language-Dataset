these words there, it seems too simple, but they are true and that's my story.
this is the refrain that could resume agathe, on a cold november night.
it is found in the same street where she was attacked a month ago, she was called a baby-sitting, feels ill at ease in this apartment too luxurious and seems to recognize the photo on a freak (as it said).
the next morning she was awakened by police and learned of the death of the type.
she warns her boyfriend gilan, which gets angry and gives more news.
the girl was then taken to doubts about her on her attacker on her boyfriend and the surroundings thereof.
and then there's the investigator who did not give up an inch.
agatha begins to lose ground and risk making mistakes to want to conduct her own little investigation.
it is not good rummage through the little papers of those we love, it can hurt.
and it's true that this novel is sad, but sadness is healthy.
it's good to read a novel of this quality, not where the chaotic sounds of a young girl lost in its bearings.
the boy she loves nothing more than a shadowy figure, and then there's murder ...
the police imagine it is linked to the theft of jewelry, perhaps a motive, and there is plenty of evidence against her, but she wants to protect her boyfriend that she suspected the bottom of it.
it is a vise, a trap that closes, in which she plays the role of rabbit hypnotized by the headlights of the hunter.
the plot is so deftly woven, simple and silent.
there is no clash, no noise.
while there is violence and rage at agatha, but behind the fragile shell.
this can not end otherwise, because this novel is terribly human.
