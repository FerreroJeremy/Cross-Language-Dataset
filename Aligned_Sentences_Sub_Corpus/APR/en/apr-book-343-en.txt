what book exhausting!
can not read it in one breath and one day the other one gets lost between the characters ... (i even re-reverse to put the murderer ...
first time in my life as it happens ...) not counting-too-many descriptions on the streets and neighborhoods of philadelphia ,-very drunk and useless.
so i asked a question the author made it a contest of pages of writing?
yet the inside story is not bad.
