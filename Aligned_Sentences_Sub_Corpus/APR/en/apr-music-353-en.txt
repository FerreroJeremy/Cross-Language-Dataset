i quite understand the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers, but i do not share all their rave reviews, listen to this double live, which seems full of flaws ...
first, i think a single disc would have been enough.
this concert is much too long.
in addition, the three tracks "stride" (including the famous "is not misbehavin '" by fats waller) seem beside the plate.
jack dejohnette is abusing the bell on the ride, and the sound of all is dull.
yet the long intro jarrett augured the best.
these musicians come to play for an audience "happy" to see their idol (history of saying, "i was "...) unless you are hooked jarrett (and yet, as a fan of jarrett i can say that this disc is disappointing compared with other previous works, a trio or quartet - that one thinks of the magnificent "survivor's suite"), this disc is not required in your purchase.
it is only the end of a trio at the end of the roll, with no idea (it's obvious at this concert at montreux).
this is unfortunate, because this trio recorded heyday ( "tales of another," "changes", "still alive", "bye bye blackbird", or their dazzling concert in norway, the sublime "standards in norway. ").
sorry, but currently, there are far more interesting trios (those of john taylor, fred hersch, bill carrothers, or ...)
