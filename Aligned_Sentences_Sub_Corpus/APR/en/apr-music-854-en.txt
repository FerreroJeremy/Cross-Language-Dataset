began a series of reissue albums by john coltrane pincipal vinyl.
the famous pocket opening was taken as the original notes.
burning and pressing are particularly neat and the vinyl itself is standard audiophile.
the music sings like no cd available: airy, natural, perfectly modulated, with a stereo image is both broad and deep.
treble have this soft side that no cd can restore.
delighted to rediscover this essential recording in a reference edition for the music (much higher than that of vinyl reissues made by the jasmine label or even impulse in the mid 80s).
