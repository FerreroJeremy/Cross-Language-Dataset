nevermind the questionable aesthetics and listen to this new cake.
my fears were unfounded: the remixes from the previous eps and new, i preferred that they remain unpublished.
ah like the novel: there is like a whiff of the bottom drawer, no arriving at the ankle of the 3 bonus tracks from singles "release" and there equals a recovery of evidence of their musical, " positive role model ".
the original is poor, not because it's neil tennant who interprets that as it is grown.
total disappointment, especially after what this pearl "release" (i compare with the novel, the remixes have no interest).
generally it principalemment the side tote of the object that irritates frankly.
still, this disc may appeal to the relentless dancefloor (and again, preference will be rather "disco 2", very successful, it) or for fans indulgent.
in short, a pure product marketing, which is very surprising from the pet shop boys.
