after waiting the kubrick box set, finally released on dvd zone 2, comprising the last 7 films that will be remembered as one of the largest realisteur 20th century.
including in addition a bonus dvd dedicated to the life of kubrick, this kit is essential for fans of filmmaker or those wishing to return to his universe.
the only negative point for the dvd of "2001 the odyssey in space" which is not the remastered release in june 2001.
but this package is a must report by the richness and quality of its content.
