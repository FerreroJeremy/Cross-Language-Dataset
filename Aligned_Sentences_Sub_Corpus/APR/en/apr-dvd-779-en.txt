this film is a real slap.
an admirer of houellebecq, the film does not merely reproduce bettement a book like today are a number of accomplishments, and plunging into the facility does not have to write a scenario, it represents the world premieres of works by houellebecq and especially one part of society today.
this film has been hunanimite with people that i watch.
undoubtedly the best film harel and garcia (this is only my opinion)
