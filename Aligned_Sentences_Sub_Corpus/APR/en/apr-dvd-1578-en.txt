here is a voice for the fans, profane, music lovers and reluctant to voice the opera!
to listen and listen again before or after the dvd of the same name.
the story of madame-fa dessay is to shudder, his stage play is also a miracle (the chorégies orange are extraordinary) ...
good listening and good escape with the divine coloratura ...
