4 tubes, including "my son, my battle" and "i'm not a hero," an album succeeded, far better than the last.
it is also the first album or songs appear in character "incurred" "death of a robot" recounting the fate of a robot who saved the world, but humans refuse to save or "10000 meters, recounting the fate of a runner, fell during the tour "too" there is in every life.
premonition, if one knows that balavoine was a trip too?
it is also the title notte "diversion" or balavoine says in a rock under a hijacked plane.
the album is well above the previous album "face face bitter love," containing songs much more original, more worked.
all the songs are maybe not masterpieces, but the album s'ecoute very well.
note the duet with michel berger, one of the few they did
