you who have lived these 70 years, you'll remember: "i'm not in love" a certain sweetness of life in the air (the light was more yellow in it this time?) sweet and calm as the sun through the leaves of an elm.
death of lisbon sisters who crushes a young middle class neighborhood, who dedicate worship these "virgin" (quasi-religious sense).
we breathe the light while brushing death, this film is like an album yellowed we remember our lost childhoods ...
