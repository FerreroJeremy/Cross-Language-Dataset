no fiercely opposed to the wave linkin park, the first album for me is a good collection of influs of all kinds, all surrounded by simple melodies and dual vocals at the time little used. 2 years later the group appears on meteora the same recipe, the problem is that this is exactly the same, almost all songs on meteora this would not work on the previous opus.
figure.09 striking example that seems almost a remix of one step closer ...
