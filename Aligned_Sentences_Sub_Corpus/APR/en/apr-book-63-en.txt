this book should also become very popular in france, when the kind of censorship that seems to practice against him is finally lifted (an influence of our "spiritual" president?).
it was released march 27, 2008, with already two years behind the publication in english, and the date of my last search, april 12, there had not yet spoken in libération, le monde (not too surprising given the involvement of world "the world of religions") and, less surprisingly, in le figaro, but even silence nouvel observateur, l'express and point.
it is a wonderful book that will help the atheists have to clean the last small remnants superstition, they still possessed.
bêtasse or belief that religion = moral principles.
