i'm a fan of this story amityville then i went out there to see this house, and indeed it exists at 108 ocean avenue in long island.
le number of the house was at the time of the massacre of 112, but it has been changed because of paparazzis.
mais whatever it recognizes it even if there is any change from that of the short film.
