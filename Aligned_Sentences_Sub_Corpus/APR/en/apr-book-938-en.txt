tony duvert is very hard for everything that is the realm of satire.
here, he tries to broaden its usual in other areas: politics (denunciation of the manipulation whose youth is the subject), lyricism (the inspiration joyce is continuing), nostalgia (as mysterious halo), poetry (the subject of the island, never tackled head on, is this all the time).
basically, the book's shift to a certain serenity.
the characters are wonderful: i confess a particular fondness pourmme lescot, the owner of the brewery that serves such good lattes: friendly, motherly, good humor invariable childlike and silly, but then silly, as n 'is not allowed.
the whole is "to vomit with laughter", said a friend.
