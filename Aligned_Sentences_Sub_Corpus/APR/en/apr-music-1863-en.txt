excellent album, a real rejuvenation for gary moore, that takes a pon hair of the beast in us offering a cd with 2 sides, first a return to hard rock trend, strongly supported by a flawless rhythm section, and a second aspect the blues, gary moore whom we had more used in recent years.
total péchu an album with guitars as always exceptional.
