this film, an early julia roberts immerses you in the love lives of three country girls who work in a pizerria.
this is the first married but does not feel ready and faces the innombrabe revive her lover, the second rather shy intellectual falls in love with the girl's father but she keeps going very quickly realize that married men wish to remain and the third (julia) rather easy girl and suspicious in his living relationship that is in the midst of conflict is between stepfather and his new little friends ..
