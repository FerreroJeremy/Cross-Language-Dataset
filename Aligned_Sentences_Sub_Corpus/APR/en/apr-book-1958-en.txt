the main character, a certain belgian named amelia, is engaging in a large japanese company, a company in which she will never be built, never accepted, never at the height of the simplest, most forbidding and most degrading tasks.
the author thus presents the world of business especially if the internal splits show us how this character could be so common we never understand the social and moral code to which they are asked to comply.
it is a caricature, certainly assumed, supported by a writing almost intuitive.
writing spun, as the pages are linked together over a continuous pen that the reader has no choice but to follow.
but it is so dispersed in digression and allegories too improbable, mystical ...
a metaphysical type ethyl which, far from being disagreeable, that brings entertainment and is at odds with the analysis promised back cover.
