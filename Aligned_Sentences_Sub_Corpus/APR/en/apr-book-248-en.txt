i began with "house of the dead", which i bought on a whim without knowing the author.
i devoured "the forest shadows," the best thriller i've read so far!
and i tried one of his early novels, saying "be tolerant, ca is a first ..." well i'm missing element!
it is really really very good!
it reads quickly, the suspense is really over until the end on several subjects, the pace is well maintained, everything is written, the story is terrible ..
and even though so horrible the topic is hard.
ca a lot of compliments, but honestly, is the ca!
for me, thill is largely passed over grange, chattam and many others.
fan of thrillers, throw you!
