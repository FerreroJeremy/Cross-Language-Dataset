in a sad suburbs of a city quelqconque japan, immature mother, struggles to survive with his four children, then abandoned.
worse for them while living in the margins, life limits, the semblance of life they had: not being noticed, cower, eating leftovers.
a life in hollow negative standards of the consumer society.
without rebellion, as stunned by the misery and injustice done to them.
still love them, solidarity, belief in the future, the wealth of childhood.
this film is absolutely singular, unique, powerful, engaging.
children are wonderful in their despair impassive.
it does not appear free of the fable about the fate of children today in the supposedly civilized country.
a film that alone redeems the time we lose, not without rejoice with the nonsense warrior and computer hollywood.
