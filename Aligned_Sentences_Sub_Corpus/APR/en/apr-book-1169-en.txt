this book was a real disappointment - i've read that there banalities, and i have trouble believing that the author is a famous writer and famous, so it has nothing to say.
she repeated a thousand times his expectations of this man, but we do not learn what it finds in him except the satisfaction of sexual desires (however, she speaks of the beauty of this relationship, but the player 's sometimes not understood what this beauty).
instead, it's so sad and hopeless (because there is no relationship without sexual intercourse).
contrary to the author, i found this book very narcissistic and very narrow, very boring, too.
the only sentence that will remain: "losing a man is old one stroke several years old with a single blow of all time did not pass, when he was there, and years to come, imagined. " but one beautiful sentence is not worth the trouble to read all this story ...
