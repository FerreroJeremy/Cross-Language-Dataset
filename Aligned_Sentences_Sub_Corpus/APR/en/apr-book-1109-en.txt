in this first volume, we do know fitzchevalerie lonvoyant, illegitimate son, as its name suggests, knight, prince heir six duchies.
by learning the existence of the boy six years while his wife patience can not have children, he abdicated.
his brother truth takes its title when he did not have the same diplomatic skills than his brother.
in these areas the gentry have names that reflect their personalities: chivalry, patience, desire, subtil, royal, etc. ...
fitz was not entitled to this particular baptism.
for years, it is called "bastard" without knowing that he had given a name "fitzchevalerie lonvoyant.
unable to claim any title of prince, but fitz is the man in the shadow of his grandfather king subtil, when at the age of 14 years, introduced him to poisons.
it is a novel that reads well, one trip to another world that seems to be the british isles in the middle ages with some fantastic subtleties.
it's dense, intense, and we hear the roar, you feel the smell, we taste of bacon and fresh bread with sharpness.
i am not sure to be eager to read the rest of the saga ...
are still 13 volumes in all.
