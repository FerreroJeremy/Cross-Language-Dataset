i am especially satisfied with the information now included the subjects of theater and the novel since 1940 as beckett and ionesco, and also on the new novel, robbe-grillet, sarraute and butor.
also sections on literature and autobiographical his stunning psychological analysis.
i am very pleased with my purchase and my colleagues, all teachers of french, are envious.
as the volume is not available in the libraries of montreal they all want me borrow.
here is the reaction it provokes.
