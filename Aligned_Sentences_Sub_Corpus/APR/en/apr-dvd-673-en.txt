the advantage of the subtitles is to capture all the subtleties that are not necessarily translated provided to understand english.
contrary to what i have read the announcement warning appears only once if you look at the dvd at once.
the packaging is disappointing, however, for a series that i expected in france for years: four basic black boxes in a cardboard box simple ...
such a monument of absurd humor deserved better, at least a superb collector's box with full bonus (also a big loss this package).
but as another commentator has said before me, the key is there: the flying circus complete with a very good image quality.
