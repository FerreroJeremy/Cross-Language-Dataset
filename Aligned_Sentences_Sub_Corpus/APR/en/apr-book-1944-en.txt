this "collection" of letters is simply perfect!
i loved the way chosen by laclos to express the idea of licentiousness prevailing at that period of history ...
handling of characters by 2 heroes is quite surprising!
and the perverse side is all the more shocking it is used in a level of very strong language, which does not detract from this masterpiece!
