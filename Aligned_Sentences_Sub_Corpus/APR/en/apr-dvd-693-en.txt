rocky balboa revives the first opus, and we literally immersed in a bath of life.
the story of a simple man who, against all odds, goes to the end of things not to end his life consumed by inner demons.
a particularly fine example in his relationship with his son who has some trouble finding his place.
a must for devotees of the series, a good story for others.
