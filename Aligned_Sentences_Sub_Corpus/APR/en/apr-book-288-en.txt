this trilogy is a pure masterpiece, taking us into a fantastic story and our young heroine is named "lyra".
philip pullman gives us the impression of transcribing the world today in his novel, which gives a gripping suspense!
i thank the author for this book which will remain engraved in my memory forever ...
and yet i do not think young children, deserve to have withdrawn their innocence by showing the harsh reality of life ...
