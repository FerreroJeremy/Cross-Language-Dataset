what memories with this movie ..!
there is no doubt the film's sci-fi of the 60s were legendary and many more bewitching than the new generation (i'm not a grumpy old nostalgic ...
i'm only 19 years) .
once in the movie, you have trouble returning to the surface of the earth, so the atmosphere is strange.
a movie with a great imagination on the part of the director, a fim or under earth's, it's forest of trees with blue leaves!
