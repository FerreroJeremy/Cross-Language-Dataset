it may be advisable to put the record straight: 1) "this" gospel "is a large scam, in fact, the gospel of judas was written long ago as more than 800 others." no, no is not a scam.
the author's presentation made clear that it is an ancient text.
yes, there were dozens of apocryphal gospels in the same period but it never decreases provided the value of this text. 2) "in addition to the translated text and duly annotated, we find a very illuminating preface, reading before the gospel, you will understand about the story of jesus to judas (esoteric and complex and cut by several lines of text).
then you have the right to a state of the manuscript and why its rediscovery in 2006 when its existence is known since the 70s.
finally, two texts would follow, explaining gnosticism, interested in the famous text of irenaeus of the second century who attacked the gospel of judas (eh yes, in fact we knew already!) and we engaged the cosmology of the gnostics, in comparison with that of the gospel of judas which differs on several points. "yes, the text is presented in clear, scientific and instructive. 3) "as many as four gospels known at least since the new testament as we know it has taken shape at the 4 th century ad, so no living witness." no, this apocryphal gospel of less value than the 4 so called "canonical".
it may nevertheless reproached his presentation of the "marketing" which suggests that this gospel may undermine christianity.
it is a shame to use a lie to sell a better quality book like this.
