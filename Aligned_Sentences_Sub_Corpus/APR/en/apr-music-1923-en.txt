many people can associate this sound track with the movie, "my fair lady" that was that is a film version of bernard shaw's play "pygmalion".
this is a classic musical with many well known songs by lerner and loewe.
however unlike many musicals, the songs have a life of their own.
even though they matched the story perfectly, they are they type of songs that one could instantly blurt out in the thrill of the moment.
i found my self that "on the street where you live" matched perfectly when i was in love in my youth.
