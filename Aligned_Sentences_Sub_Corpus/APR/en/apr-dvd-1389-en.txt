if you've seen the trailer for this movie: do not trust it because it evokes a more somber series z as the true masterpiece that is this movie.
superbly filmed in scope in the majestic scenery of kashmir, the story unfolds against a backdrop of terrorist attacks and provides ample surprises.
it's an action movie treated as a saga (it takes half past two) and this makes it a highly original work. "mission kashmir" even managed at times to be simply poignant (the players are geniuses).
only small criticism: the songs are not always well distributed (they are mostly confined around half of the film) and one of them is even completely offset in the context (i can not say more without revealing the history).
