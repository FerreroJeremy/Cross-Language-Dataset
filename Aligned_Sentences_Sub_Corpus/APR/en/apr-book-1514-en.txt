reads one deals with a lot of fun and laughing a lot.
the author does not lack wit or humor, and he returns a few shots, it's always funny and great accuracy.
although american, the author writes in french, which shows a perfect mastery of the language and expressions franchouillard she likes now.
so much so that it is difficult to believe that it is not the country.
but it only increases the pleasure and content of the book reminds us pafaitement his point of view native of ohio, and the contrast makes it even funnier and more credible.
it took some courage on the part of the author to publish in the land of gaul, a review of this strange country and its no less funny people.
but it is true, is it something that cocks bawling like more than to hear talk about themselves?
and the author certainly demonstrates a great affection for our country and its peoples.
his remarks often just touch and help us see ourselves as we often are.
four stars only because the book reads more quickly than it would and was already finished when we want to again!
