after review of the ouhman friend of paris 18, with which i fully share his vision and appreciation in this poignant film about the life, then the desperation of a jewish famile in paris under the german occupancy, i don ' have little to add except to say that i am also of opinion on these excellent actors, regretting that julie depardieu, daughter of the great dignified gerard, is not more used for "major role".
this should not delay to come.
