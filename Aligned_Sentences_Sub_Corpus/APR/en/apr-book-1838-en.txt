personellement i began seeing the movies then i decided to buy the 3 livres.
malgré some delays at the beginning of the book, it tells exactly the film but with much more detail allowing the reader finally understand example is gollum.
toutes scenes are detailed and the detail is what makes us love this lecture.
si you liked the movies, you'll love these books ...
