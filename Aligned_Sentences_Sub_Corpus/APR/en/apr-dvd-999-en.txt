this is a must have for each and everyone who loves comedies with a deeper sense of humor.
the story is as small as it should be to be written on the back of a stamp: three guys go to jail and have to share the same cell, they do not like each other, but they have to escape together.
the film works without many words.
the characters are so obvious that they do not need much of a dialogue to be funny.
this is a trio never seen before: roberto benigni at his best, john lurie as the silent man, and tom waits mythologizing himself as always. ...
and not to forget the thrilling music of tom waits, which turns the opening of the film to mere art.
definitively the best jarmush and a cult film of the eighties.
