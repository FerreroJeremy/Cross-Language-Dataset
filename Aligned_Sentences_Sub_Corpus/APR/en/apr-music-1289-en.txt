i was delighted when i learned that nolwenn out his second album.
this young woman showed us during 4 months full extent of his talent and potential of his beautiful voice.
unfortunately, this second album is a big disappointment: we hardly hear ...
an accompanying loud and inappropriate, a digitized voice and so on.

furthermore, all of the songs are boring and bland, unfortunately.
i sincerely hope that the third album is better quality, but since this second album pleases the audience (consisting largely of pre-adolescent (e) s), i'm afraid this is nolwenn crénau singers whispering that leave a thin voice and offers the public and commercial pieces that will likely be empty forgotten within a year or two ...
