it was fashionable at the time of vinyl to consider the taste of a rock music lover was equal to the degree of wear on the cover of his vinyl copy of "white light white heat." well well, i think my album on vinyl was in condition "mint".
i always thought that we had overestimated the album that should find "cool" among rock critics.
with the exception of the title song, songs are boring and not particularly great musicality.
i suggest rather alban as "velvet underground &amp; nico" or "velvet underground" and in a lesser degree "loaded"
