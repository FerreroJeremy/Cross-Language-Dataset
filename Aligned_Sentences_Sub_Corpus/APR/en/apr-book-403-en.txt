it had long since i had read a book so enjoyable!
under the guise of a book simple and unpretentious, this is a very original style to tell a deep story and just through small words exchanged throughout a lifetime by a boy and a girl, became a young man and young woman, then a man and a woman ...
freshness of style, accuracy of events and depth of feelings are that i heartily recommend this novel as delightful to read than to eat chocolate!
