i found the french translation a bit too literal ...
some phrases or certain words do not always reflect the spirit or meaning of the english text, or show up far too simplistic.
it's a shame, but it is not serious, it's still a good base, especially as others have said, an excellent book chronologically.
it is also a very good book under a unique format that wants to browse and discover its friends.
