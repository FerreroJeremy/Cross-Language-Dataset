alice in chains is a crucial group in the world of heavy rock.
being in seattle like nirvana, pearl jam and soundgarden, the band displays a certain independence from the grunge movement of the time. "dirt" is an album tormented and tortured he feels despair as evidenced by the texts sung by the haunting voice of layne staley.
he comes to the countless references heroine and the malaise of layne staley and guitarist jerry cantrell that inflicts herculean riffs and macabre melodies worthy of black sabbath ( "sickman", "rooster" or "angry chair").
this is certainly why alice in chains decided to repeat the adventure coming out very soon a new album despite the death of lead singer in 2002.
