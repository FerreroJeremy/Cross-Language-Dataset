hello, bernard werber we were accustomed to better.
this novel is sloppy (although i acknowledge that i am unable to do so).
too many references to previous works, no originality.
a story totally unbelievable and very disappointing from the author of the cycle of ants or the encyclopedia of relative and absolute knowledge that they, showed great imagination and boundless, with relatively credible scientific references.
apparently, the limits are reached and this book is that to sell the paper.
there is still awaiting the 3rd volume of the gods.
