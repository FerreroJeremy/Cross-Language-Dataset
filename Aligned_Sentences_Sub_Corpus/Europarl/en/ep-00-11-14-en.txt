In the modification of the agenda for Thursday the subject of the British submarine in Gibraltar was discussed and there were three speakers.
Thank you, Mr Aparicio Sánchez.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months' work and a long struggle for consensus, we now have a draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Today is the day we have to say 'yes' or 'no' to this Charter and your rapporteurs recommend that plenary adopt and vote in favour of this Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Like many of you, I too regret that we are only allowed to say yes or no and are unable to send the Council any other political message which might have been called for in this context in order to express the critical support of this House for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is but a first step and is still a far cry from what Parliament demanded of this political project in March of this year.
Vague formulations and legal principles have given way to a clear system of fundamental rights which is binding on all the EU institutions and whenever European law is applied by the Member States.
The value of this Charter is that it has transformed rights vested in international law - vested but not binding, vested but not enforceable, vested but not guaranteed - into legal principles, nay into the constitutional principles of the Union itself, setting up a dynamic process which will surely end one day with a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This Charter is also the expression of a common set of basic values for all the candidate countries, for all the countries wishing to join the European Union, and it is precisely in the area of social rights that it sends candidate countries a clear message that they must comply with these social standards.
I am certain that, with this Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have laid the foundation stone for a future European constitution and constitutional process.
It is hard to see why the right to a fair wage has been left out and why we came up against insurmountable resistance when it came to the right to a decent minimum standard of living, the right to work and the right to housing.
Madam President, whatever one felt about the mandate from the Cologne European Council, it was fairly surprising that the convention set up to draft the Charter fully succeeded in achieving the mandate.
We refrained from superseding the Treaties but maximised their impact by making the relationship between the citizen and the Union for the first time clear and visible.
Parliament played a strong part is formulating the Charter.
I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the House as part of an in-depth debate on this fine project to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union before Parliament adopts its final position on this text.
Admittedly, we have already exchanged views on this matter on two occasions, firstly on 3 October, following an oral question from the Chairman of your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Giorgio Napolitano, and then on 24 October, when I came to Parliament to present the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October, where, indeed, the Charter was one of the major items on the agenda.
For all that, however, today' s debate, in my opinion, is a far cry from being needless repetition.
It is, on the contrary, particularly important as today Parliament is to decide if, as is urged by the conclusions of the Cologne Council, it is going to proclaim this text, jointly with the Council and the Commission, at the European Council meeting in Nice, which is less than a month away now.
This is quite clearly a major political decision and a fresh opportunity to show the citizens of Europe the whole scope of this initiative.
As you know, this position is in line with that adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Biarritz European Council who unanimously and unreservedly approved the Charter, and I can only urge you, therefore, on behalf of the Council, to follow suit, perhaps giving you a few reasons to do so.
So, with a concern for openness which paid off in the end, in the course of its work the Convention heard from the major European non-governmental organisations, both sides of industry in Europe and, importantly, too, for the future, the candidate countries.
I know that the Convention experiment already clearly appears to be one of the avenues - one, but not the only avenue - which Europe could follow up in future in order to be more transparent and in touch with the opinions of European citizens.
Members of the European Parliament, particularly in our previous debate, have already expressed the wish to repeat the experiment.
Moreover, at a time when we have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I think we can safely leave it to the judges of both institutions to fuel and continue the dialogue they already maintain, which is undoubtedly adequate guarantee against any risk of the two-speed Europe of human rights that some people have mentioned.
It also enshrines many new rights which are not included in the Convention and which are necessitated by developments in our societies, be it in terms of technological development, the emergence of new dependencies, or even the increasing complexity of our state and administrative systems.
It is particularly important that European citizens should know, for example, that the European Union prohibits all human cloning for reproductive purposes or that it guarantees its citizens protection of their personal data.
Let me, once again, congratulate President Herzog in person, who, I believe, was behind this.
This is the solidarity which the Charter guarantees through the right to free education, the right of workers to be informed and consulted, the right to collective bargaining and action, including the right to strike, even if it was not easy to get it included in the text, but also through the right to protection against unjustified dismissal, the right to social protection and the ban on children working.
I shall also stress Article 23, which is particularly clear in stipulating equality between men and women, and stating that this must be ensured in all areas, and that the principle of equality shall not prevent the adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.
Overall, I should say that this text unquestionably marks the greatest collective advance in terms of affirming social rights, both because of the importance of the rights enshrined and also because these rights are included for the first time in the same text as civic and political rights, thereby officially signposting the indivisible nature of all fundamental rights.
As to the method, let me remind you that the Convention itself determined its own rules of procedure, without any external pressure, and that the rule of consensus seemed to be a particularly constructive option in a body as diverse as the Convention.
I am sure the Convention members that are to speak here will be able to confirm that.
The European Trade Union Confederation, for its part, saw fit to complain about what it considers to be some omissions, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income, for example.
I should therefore like to make a few things clear once again.
The purpose of the Charter was to collate the fundamental rights, not, at this stage, to form a social treaty - regrettable as that may be, and it may be something that will come in time - and the Convention' s mandate, as stipulated in the initial specification, did not entitle it to create completely new social rights out of nothing.
So, as you know, the Presidency, on the basis of the conclusions of the Lisbon Council, has launched the initiative of a social agenda, intended to determine what action the European Union will undertake in the next few years in order to take existing needs in to account, providing, in particular, a qualitative and quantitative improvement in employment, as well as greater social cohesion.
The Heads of State and Government were alive to this determination when they, if not adopted - that is still to come in Nice - at least approved the text of the Charter.
Let me now, in conclusion, turn to the matter of the legal status of the Charter, which has already been mentioned.
I can assure you, then, since it will not be possible to pose this question officially until after Nice, that the French Presidency fully intends to strive to include this perspective in the conclusions of the Nice European Council.
The fact remains that several individuals, Members of the European Parliament in particular, have suggested that explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already refers to the European Convention on Human Rights.
You know that, in a personal capacity, I have shown my openness to this proposal, and even my support for it, and I would reiterate that here.
I am convinced then, that this Charter, by virtue of its clarity, its coherence and its content, will come to the fore as the benchmark text which the European Union so badly needed.
I can only, therefore, on behalf of the Council Presidency, urge you once again to adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights with a view to its joint official proclamation in Nice.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the main tasks of the directly-elected members of the European Parliament, which represents the 370 million citizens of the European Union, is to bring the unifying structure of Europe closer to its people.
It is a huge feather in this institution's cap - as is the fact that the groups stood side by side here - that we managed to secure 16 places for European Parliament representatives at the fundamental rights convention.
Ladies and gentlemen - and I mean everyone involved from the European Parliament - made a decisive contribution; as a result, the difficult instructions of the Cologne European Council were carried out successfully in a very short space of time and with the maximum possible attention.
But our special thanks must go to all the members of the convention, especially its chairman, former president of the Federal Republic of Germany, Roman Herzog, to whom I should like at this point to wish a speedy recovery.
The draft before us is a balanced text which has already been applauded on all sides as an example of European consensus.
But Europe will only progress and find its feet if we are all prepared to help bring about a good result.
The Charter before us is, to my mind, a huge success and may, as I read in one of the European broadsheets on 26 September 2000, become the calling card for Europe.
In saying yes, we are instructing you, Madam President, to proclaim the Charter with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at the EU summit in Nice in a few weeks' time.
If we, as the representatives and trustees of the citizens of the European Union and of Europe as a whole, wish to continue with the unification of our continent in an ambitious and committed manner, then the solemn proclamation cannot but be a first step along the way.
We in the European People's Party are jointly and firmly committed to including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaties as quickly as possible so that it can become a Charter of direct and unassailable rights for the people of the European Union.
Mr President-in-Office, you have taken a stand here and I hear what you are saying but let me say quite clearly on behalf of the European People's Party that we expect an ambitious result from Nice - an ambitious result on the conditions for enlargement of the European Union and an ambitious result for the Charter, which is why I again call on the Presidency of the Council, on behalf of the members of the European People's Party, to ensure that a timetable is drawn up for transposing the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the EU Treaties.
I would like to remind you that the first time that the declaration of rights was discussed was at the Congress of Europe in The Hague in 1948, and that was the origin of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe.
I think that this needs to be highlighted today because the work that we have carried out is not the exclusive property of any political family, and this gesture does credit to the German Presidency at the time and shows that we all need to move forward together in achieving fundamental values.
I think that we have also done this in the European Parliament.
I have had the opportunity to express my admiration for the work carried out by Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, as chairman of the European Parliament delegation.
I would also like to point out the crucial role played by my colleague Mrs Pervenche Berès, when she led the delegation from the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Our governments need to obtain tangible results in Nice that they can offer to our citizens - institutional matters are important but, as the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner are well aware, they are difficult to sell to public opinion.
Therefore, my Group still thinks that it is absolutely essential to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6(2) of the Treaty.
As I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council is going to have a very busy weekend with the next meeting, I ask him to pass on a message to that meeting, so that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs can pass it on to the Heads of Government.
It is as follows: if the European Council in Nice does not succeed in integrating the Charter in this way, I am afraid that the European Parliament will have difficulty approving the reform of the Treaties.
I think that this is a positive message that the President-in-Office of the Council must give to his colleagues, because we still have time to include the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaties.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a key stage in the construction of Europe, has given rise to much discussion.
Everything conspired to strengthen this hope: the formation of the Convention which established a new precedent in relation to the usual intergovernmental method, the public debates and the full set of texts available on an Internet site that was accessible to everyone, as well as the fact that the opinion of civil society was consulted.
The right to employment was transformed into the right to work.
The right to health, social security, accommodation or a minimum income either do not feature, or are expressed only as a token of social cohesion.
Discrimination between European and third country residents is ratified, as is the freedom of movement laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, or the right to live as a family, even though this is recognised in international law.
As regards fundamental rights, is it possible to accept a minimal common denominator at a time when Europe wishes to set itself up as a role model for human rights?
At the European Summit in Nice, in December, civil society resolved to mobilise in order to make itself heard and to forcefully express its desire for a charter offering the citizens of Europe genuine guarantees.
We must support these actions and, rather than accepting a shaky text, we must call upon the Convention to continue working after Nice, involving new procedures and extensive public debate.
Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a very important project for the future of European integration and it has my support.
Secondly, because it plugs a gap in the protection of fundamental rights for people living in the Union.
Thirdly, because the Charter also ensures that the current level of protection in the European Human Rights Convention also applies in the Union; in fact, at some points, it goes even further than the European Human Rights Convention.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe this Charter is nothing more than the umpteenth example of the ability of the European Union and its Member States to proliferate empty texts and declarations of intent.
Behind the vote on the Charter, there is an ill-concealed agenda to create the first part of a constitution for what might be called a United States of Europe.
The Charter will not, of course, be written into the Treaty until after a special constitutional conference in 2004 but, as it receives the solemn signature of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, the European Court of Justice will already be acquiring a new source for its judgements, and the Court of Justice' s representative has, of course, already given notice that it will draw inspiration from the Charter.
The European Court of Justice will become our new Supreme Court and constitutional court, including in all issues relating to fundamental and human rights, and it will also become the chief interpreter of the European Declaration of Human Rights.
Madam President, first my heartfelt thanks to my friend and delegation leader Méndez de Vigo, who swapped places with me because I was due to head a conciliation for parliament.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is to become part of a future European constitutional treaty - a constitutional treaty, mind you, not a constitution -, in order to make it perfectly clear that the European Union is not a state, it is not a nation state; on the contrary, the European Union goes its own separate way.
If we want Europe to succeed, we need to define these concepts clearly; if we want Europe to succeed, we need a streamlined Europe.
Let us remember that this was originally an initiative from Felipe Gonzales, who proposed this fine idea.
Some Members of this House, including in my own political family, in the widest sense, will deplore the lack of reference to a minimum income, the right to accommodation or the lack of any explicit reference to the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights in the general provisions of the text.
I would, however, urge them to read the text carefully.
The Charter has actually been drawn up as if it were a text which might become binding.
To adopt an expression used by Catherine Lalumière, I would say that we have to "put it into orbit" .
In order to do so, we all need to work hand in hand, on the basis of, I hope, the largest possible vote by this House.
This means that we must all get involved, Members of the European Parliament, members of the national parliaments, the Council, of course, the national government, but also that same civil society which supported us in the process of drawing up the text.
My impression was that, even though several governments did not want it, there might still be a clear majority in favour of a reference in Article 6.
This is the mandate we have given our representatives.
As far as Parliament is concerned, the phase we are about to enter is the outcome of a long struggle, one we undertook as early as 1975 and which has been continually highlighted through our resolutions, our Spinelli draft treaties, our draft European constitutions.
That right does not exist in other international documents, and it is absent from the constitutions of many Member States.
The Charter also opens the way to minority rights because Article 22 says that the European Union must respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
It has been so successful that, in his speech last Friday, the Finnish Prime Minister singled out the method as a way of coming up with ideas in anticipation of a future EU constitution.
We have a text here which states concisely what Europe is about and states what rights we uphold as citizens of this great Union.
As I said last night - I will say it again today - there are too many failings in that respect all across this Union and sometimes, in our eagerness to develop judicial and police cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not made the passive victims, the collateral damage of a war against crime.
Let us not merely adopt these rights but make them real in the hearts and in the experience of our citizens and let us make them part of our law.
Madam President, I do not underestimate the very important ambition of establishing a community of humanitarian values or the fact that civil, political and social rights have been placed on a par for the first time in this type of text.
There is a significant gap between our initial ambitions and what we have actually achieved.
It is, of course, possible to highlight this or that article, to welcome the genuine progress made in affirming a number of new rights relating to developments in our societies or in reaffirming crucial fundamental rights.
Finally, precisely because the decision on the Charter is a major political decision, I am with those Members of the House that think it premature for Parliament to declare its opinion today.
Madam President, the draft European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights has the same ambiguous foundation as the work of the body itself.
We will find out at a later date, after Nice, no doubt.
There are two aspects in this process which I find fascinating.
Tomorrow, however, the Court of Justice is going to be able to interpret these rights in detail and the Court' s case law is going to be applied in a standardised fashion throughout Europe, depriving each national democracy of its right of autonomous decision.
Madam President, this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Madam President, in answer to the question as to whether Parliament should participate in the official promulgation of the Charter I would simply say 'no' .
Apart from the substantive problems already raised today, merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in-depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments.
I would also advise the House not to misconstrue the instrument of the convention as a deus ex machina of the European Union.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights has always been a priority for this Parliament, because it has wanted the principles and values that unite Europeans to be reflected in a text.
This is particularly important at the present time, when we are beginning an ambitious process of enlargement.
The second reason is because the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an essential factor in the move towards political union.
Thirdly, Mr President, and surely this is the most important reason, because a Charter of Fundamental Rights is going to increase the feeling of belonging to the European Union.
Moreover, this Charter reflects the opinion of Parliament, as we set it out in our Duff/Voggenhuber Resolution on 16 March.
The Charter has been drawn up with the participation of a delegation from Parliament and, as chairman of this delegation, I would like to thank all its members for their work, their commitment and their support over all these months.
It is true, as one of the speakers said, that we have to make an effort to inform people about the Charter, an effort that can begin in this Parliament.
When listening to the speeches from some members, one realises that this information is more necessary than ever.
Mr President, allow me to say a few words on the effects of the Charter.
I think that the reference to Article 6 is logical and I think that the President-in-Office of the Council should take note of what Mr Barón Crespo said.
The chairman of the group to which the majority of governments in the European Union belong said quite clearly that Parliament - or in any event, his group - will not approve the reform of the Treaty of Nice if no reference is made in Article 6.
If you read the report of the three wise men on the situation in Austria, you will see that the Charter is mentioned on three occasions.
This report was drawn up between 29 August and 6 September, when the Charter had still not been drafted.
Therefore, the Charter, whether or not it is included in the Treaties, whether or not it is in Article 6(2), will bind the Commission - and I would like to highlight the important work done by Commissioner Vitorino in drawing up the Charter - will bind Parliament and will bind the Council, and it will have effects, Mr President, whether some Members of this House like it or not.
This is a Charter that brings together rights that belong to no party and to every party.
It is a fusion of existing European values in a contemporary and imaginative way.
All sections of the House who are interested in the development of the European Union should welcome that.
It is also, the Commission points out, contemporary because it deals with issues such as bioethics, genetic engineering and data protection as well as access to information.
Secondly, to say to the institutions: you have a duty, that is expressed in this Charter, to deal with the citizens in a certain way.
I agree with colleagues who say the Court is not going to ignore a Charter that has been proclaimed solemnly by the three institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Charter for Europe and for the citizens of the European Union is a fine thing.
I say this as a federalist, well aware that that the principle we shall have to refer to one day will be the principle of subsidiarity in order to attain greater freedom for the peoples of Europe, including my own people, the people of the Val d'Aosta, which has always encouraged federalism in Italy and in Europe.
In order to provide an international guarantee for the linguistic minorities, we have to make progress in terms of a genuine European constitution.
What prevented the achievement of both results is, Minister, the same thing that will prevent the achievement of a satisfactory outcome in terms of democracy and effectiveness at Nice: the obligation to reach unanimity on every single part of the text.
Those who are more backward and more reactionary have, once again, triumphed over those who are fighting to see fundamental rights applied to all people and for an effective, legally binding response to new issues such as the risks of science, the rights of the new citizens, the right to a healthy environment etc.
This Charter on social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many of the Member States and, thanks precisely to the referrals to these laws, it will serve as a tool to alter them or limit their effectiveness.
I only hope that it will not be incorporated into the Treaties and that movements calling for a fairer Europe, in which there is a genuine increase in solidarity, will flourish in civil society, in the trade unions and in political organisations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament is marking a new, important stage in the European Union's journey, towards a more united and - I hope - fairer and more honest Europe.
Mr President, in the recommendation which is the subject of this debate Parliament approves the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
But this Charter is clearly aimed at furthering the ever-closer union of the peoples of Europe.
The Charter fills a gap in EC law and strengthens the individual' s protection against infringements by European police, by authorities which combat fraud and by authorities which regulate competition.
How, otherwise, will a legal area of 500 million people be able to operate?
The Charter constitutes a balanced and solid basis for enlargement.
I repeat, this Charter turns the Union into a Community of rights; it is a step forwards in the process of constitutionalisation of the Union and it is the first international document to contain, according to the principle of the indivisibility of fundamental rights, civil and political rights, economic and social rights and new rights, all together.
It is on the basis of formulae such as these articles that, in time, our law-courts guaranteed our fundamental rights.
No, the words which embody our principles, our values and our fundamental rights are powerful if we embrace them and apply them to our civil lifestyles.
Mr President, I have long been among the sceptics.
If we really want to reinforce human rights at European level, we ought instead to employ our energy on strengthening the work of the Council of Europe and on having the EU ratify the European Convention on Human Rights and the corresponding conventions on cultural and social rights, instead of slowly developing a system to compete with the Council of Europe, as we are now in the process of doing.
For the first time since the European Union was established we have here the basis of a constitution, a constitution for the supranational structure that is the European Union.
My third observation concerns the rights of citizens from third countries.
Mr President, it was a great honour to be able to work with my colleagues in the European Parliament and from the national parliaments on drawing up this Charter.
We would like to thank Roman Herzog and Iñigo Méndez de Vigo for steering the convention to such outstanding effect and we sincerely hope that the Charter will be endorsed in Nice with the signature of our President Nicole Fontaine.
It is a demonstration for a social and democratic Europe of the citizens.
For a start, they must incorporate an amendment to Article 6 of the EU Treaty.
Mr President, national constitutions either fail to incorporate social fundamental rights, individual freedom rights and environmental protection or do so to an unsatisfactory extent.
For some rights it will even mean a retrograde step.
In the meantime, the draft Charter can serve as an interesting subject for debate amongst the parties, trade unions, environmental organisations, churches and the many other groupings in the Member States and the candidate states of the Union, regarding future cooperation between European nations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, power requires control.
I, for one, am delighted that, for a variety of reasons, the Union has not acceded to the Convention on Human Rights As it stands, the Charter which we shall be voting for today - I hope by a large majority -, will clearly afford us better protection of our fundamental rights which is more in keeping with the times than acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights would have done.
The solemn proclamation must pave the way for binding European constitutional law.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all I wish to associate myself with the congratulations quite rightly heaped on all those who participated in the Convention, especially Mr Méndez de Vigo and my colleague, Mrs Pervenche Berès.
I wish to focus on three points that have already been raised by other Members here this morning.
Secondly, I wish to focus on the binding nature of this Charter.
The European public would not understand if Europe were to move faster in making improvements to the market and the currency but more slowly in effectively establishing its rights of citizenship and its basic rights.
Thirdly, I wish to emphasise, as has already been done, that the Nice conclusions and, specifically, the revision of the Treaty, should include this reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6(2).
That is why, once again, we urge and insist that the Presidency should be able to exercise the role of teacher towards its peers in the Council.
However, as has been pointed out many times, the text does not have the legal status of a treaty.
The final objective is to establish a European Constitution, a fundamental law for a Union, which cannot stop at simply having a single currency but must become a political entity with genuinely common foreign and defence policies, an interlocutor on a par with the United States which will be able to take up the great challenge of globalisation in which the countries of the continent of Asia are also set to become protagonists in the coming years, starting with China.
The text which we are going to adopt today, parts of which, being the result of a compromise - as President Poettering said - fail to satisfy us, must be instrumental in triggering a large-scale debate on the future and on the future European Constitution.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights must confer binding legal status upon the rights and establish the levels of responsibility of the Union, the States and the regions, and it must bear the people's seal of approval.
In the conviction that the Europe of the future must increasingly safeguard individual rights and the rights of the family and that it must prevent the return of new forms of racism and anti-Semitism, the Members of Forza Italia and the European People's Party will vote for the recommendation accompanying the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say thank you to the participants in the Convention, both from Parliament and from the Commission and the Council.
The Charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon.
It is important that these two bodies should not lose their authority.
I believe that adopting the Charter in Nice will be a powerful signal to certain applicant countries of the seriousness with which the EU regards respect for the fundamental freedoms.
This is the most modern fundamental rights document in the world today and it really does deserve our special appreciation.
As far as I can see, the convention has extracted everything worth its weight in fundamental rights from over 31 legal sources.
Within Europe, the European citizen knows that Europe is now not just an economic entity; within the candidate countries, no country will be able to aspire to join the European Union without ensuring that its national legal system adheres to the principles of the Charter; and finally, on the world scale, this is the message sent out by Europe.
There are, however, other effects, particularly on our internal legal system.
Once adopted by this House, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will serve as a benchmark for my report and, as far as I can with my own personal and intellectual resources and those of the people assisting me, I shall carry out an evaluation, right by right and country by country, of the extent to which the Charter is respected in the fifteen countries of the European Union.
For instance, in the area of criminal law the abrogation of the right to extradite fugitives to countries which allow the death penalty could mean that Europe becomes a sanctuary for American murderers.
This Charter is not only potentially damaging but unnecessary given the fact that we already have the European Convention on Human Rights which was supported in 1950 by the great Conservative, Winston Churchill, and Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
We have witnessed the hypocrisy in this House when the left-wing were not prepared to support my motion on the Italian royal family's rights being restored.
Mr President, with the vote on the Charter we are setting off once again along the road towards a European Constitution.
I should just like to stress two points which the Commission sees as essential.
The principle that political, economic and social rights are indivisible cannot be seen as a minor matter or a way of settling accounts with the past.
The principle of the indivisibility of fundamental rights is a political compromise with regard to the future, especially at a time when some people think that untrammelled globalisation or the hegemony/dominance of the financial markets must be guaranteed by sacrificing citizens' social rights.
It is subject only to the key concept of the worth of the human being within the construction of Europe in the first place, and secondly to a certain vision of the social model, a social model in which solidarity and respect for fundamental rights are compatible with economic competitiveness at world level.
This is an important amalgamation at a time when the European Union is required to define the legal status, in terms of rights and duties, of third country nationals legally resident within the European Union.
I see it as a foundation stone providing a basis for social development, even insofar as its legal status is concerned.
I think the objective of ensuring the indivisibility of fundamental rights is critical, and that the Council, the Commission and Parliament should make special efforts to publish and distribute the Charter among European citizens, but I am quite sure that, above and beyond the political instructional quality of the Charter, its legal impact is going to make itself felt, particularly with regard to the institutions proclaiming it.
I am convinced that the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself will not be able to ignore the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when acting, in future, in a legislative or executive capacity.
In this respect I am disappointed to hear the criticisms of legal activism which have been made, as I, in fact, wonder whether the greatest incentive to activism is not specifically provided by Article 6(2) of the Treaty, which refers to the vague, abstract concept of the shared constitutional tradition of the fifteen Member States, instead of referring to a Charter containing 48 clear, readable articles.
Finally, you are aware that the Commission is of the opinion that the Convention has drawn up a text which is destined, sooner or later, to be incorporated into the Treaties.
It is destined to be incorporated in to the Treaties and the Commission thinks this should be fully realised as part of the reorganisation of the treaties we proposed at the Intergovernmental Conference, which we hope the European Council will be able to approve in Nice.
Listening to this debate, I am pleased to see what appears to be a clear majority in Parliament in favour of this text, even if there a number of you still have to be won over.
The Charter therefore, I am convinced, properly belongs to the political acquis communautaire.
It was a clear-cut choice between either a substantial text which was liable not to be binding in the short term or a text which perhaps had some chance of being binding in the short term but which would have lost any content.
The Commissioner has just mentioned the spirit in which the Charter was drawn up, with a view to its being made, one day, a binding text.
Never in the history of European construction has the principle of transparency been applied with such determination and with such success.
Let me remind you that ETUC, for example, representing 60 million employees in Europe, was consulted, that several hundred NGOs were consulted, that citizens had the opportunity to simply submit their contributions and that some of their proposals were adopted by the Convention.
The Convention chose to include fundamental rights inspired by various texts of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and Member State constitutions.
The human rights included in the Charter are powerful ones.
The Charter affirms the social values of European construction.
It also most forcefully affirms the equality of men and women in all areas, as well as the principle of non-discrimination.
The point I wanted to make in mentioning all this is that Nice is a vital stage.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
This is the spirit in which the preparatory work for this report was carried out within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and I should like, at this point, to thank all my fellow members for the contribution they made towards finalising this report, which, like the Commission, concludes that Turkey does not currently fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
We must applaud the remarkable efforts Turkey has made, since the Helsinki decision, in devising a programme to develop its judicial framework in order to meet EU demands in a more satisfactory manner, with particular regard to human rights.
However, we must also note and acknowledge that an awareness of the importance of these reforms has caused considerable upheavals in the various political parties and in Turkish public opinion.
Lengthy debates will be needed, both in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments, and that is why it is generally accepted that the road will be long and difficult.
The European Parliament will have to tell its Turkish partners very clearly in the debates in that Forum that they need have no fear of any European desire to interfere in their internal affairs and that, on the contrary, it is proposing a contract, the precise details of which are being thrashed out, in the accession partnership, Commissioner, and, of course, in the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
As matters stand, it is also up to the European Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are, today, at least three conditions for accession which Turkey must meet.
Firstly, the need for identity must be respected: this need has been demonstrated particularly clearly in Europe by its citizens who wish to preserve their origins in the face of the ineluctable progress of globalisation.
It is in this spirit that it is prepared to help Turkey find a solution to the Kurdish problem in particular.
Finally, since the fight against terrorism may now be deemed to be over, the influence of the Turkish army in the drawing up of political decisions should be gradually reduced.
In 1987, Parliament acknowledged the Armenian genocide.
This would run counter to the spirit and the letter of the process defined in Copenhagen for all candidate countries.
The Council is proposing with unanimity that Turkey should join the group of recipients of guarantees, and Parliament' s Committee on Budgets is also unanimous in this.
Through its application for membership, Turkey has given the Union the right to adopt a position on its internal affairs.
Besides, conditions could not have been imposed exclusively by a decision of the European Parliament.
I would like to focus attention on how little Parliament is able to influence the work of the European Investment Bank and how badly the European Union monitors that work in general.
In the European Parliament we would in general like to impose conditions on European Investment Bank loans as far as environmental considerations and the social protection of the citizens of non-member countries are concerned, and, in the case of Turkey, this also concerns a respect for human rights.
The problems associated with the monitoring and examination of the management of the European Investment Bank also stem from the fact that there are only representatives of the Member States in its governing body, and some of them want to prevent the Commission and the European Parliament from taking a stand on bank matters.
I am, of course, thinking of the work undertaken within the Association Council with a view to bringing Turkish legislation into line with the acquis communautaire.
I have noted reservations on the part of many people, not just within the European Parliament, but also in all the Member States.
We all agree that negotiations cannot in any case commence, let me stress that fact, until Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria in full.
We are indeed all aware, yourselves, the Council Presidency and also, I believe, the Commission, whose latest report on the progress achieved in Turkey stressed once again the efforts this country still needs to made, the reforms still to be implemented in areas as crucial as respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and minority rights, in particular, areas in which, as we can only regret, progress is still too slow and even inadequate.
That is why, in the same spirit, the European Union must fulfil the commitments it has made with regard to this country, which I think it imperative to meet, particularly in terms of financial aid.
The French Presidency has made this one of its objectives and I believe we are making progress.
This House has, of course, on several occasions been invited to give an opinion on this matter, be it the MEDA Programme or the financial regulations proposed by the Commission to ensure Euro-Turkish rapprochement and to support the customs union, but there are also the European Investment Bank projects, which are essential in order to support Turkey' s economic development and to continue the reconstruction work undertaken following the earthquake.
For its part, the Presidency would like to see this special action programme of EIB loans adopted by the Council very soon, probably as early as the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers of Economic and Financial Affairs on 27 November.
I would add that we are all awaiting with keen interest the proposal announced by the Commission for a single regulation intended to coordinate all sources of Community aid to Turkey, in line with the plans made in Helsinki.
Parliament will, of course, have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on this matter, when the time comes.
As you know, however, this pre-accession aid will be more particularly intended to help Turkey achieve the objectives laid down in the future accession partnership agreement.
This is a key instrument in the pre-accession strategy for this country, and its importance was rightly highlighted in the recent Commission report.
This is a proposal which is going to be examined in detail by the competent Council bodies, so you will understand that I cannot, in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, afford to pre-judge the situation.
The Presidency' s preference is for this draft to be adopted very quickly, indeed, if possible, as early as 20 November, the date of the forthcoming General Affairs Council, and, as I have already mentioned, for it to comply with the very specific decisions adopted in Helsinki.
It will then be up to Turkey to take its inspiration from this in order to work out its own national programme to integrate the acquis and in order to implement the reforms, all the reforms necessary, with the support of the European Union.
Let us be demanding, let us be vigilant, but at the same time, let us remain consistent with the logic of our decision, making a bet on Turkey, having confidence in its determination for rapprochement with the European Union, and let us therefore assist Turkey to boost its ability to implement the necessary reforms which we quite legitimately expect of the country.
As you know, not only has the Commission recently submitted the progress report for the year 2000; it has also proposed an accession partnership for the very first time in the history of our relations.
This draft resolution highlights our common objective of bringing Turkey closer to the European Union.
We can already see that the Helsinki process has set a series of interesting and important developments in motion.
The most important thing, as far as I am concerned, is that Helsinki triggered a debate in Turkey, a public debate on the conditions of Turkey's accession to the EU, a debate which is supporting and bolstering the forces of reform in Turkey.
For example, the Human Rights Committee in the Turkish national assembly has reported on torture in Turkey and the Turkish government has passed a resolution to bring the Turkish constitution and the Turkish legal system into line with the values of the European Union.
I think that the accession partnership which we have tabled is the best way of supporting this process and of ensuring that the European Union is able to exert the necessary influence on the process itself.
I have stressed time and again in my contacts with the Turkish Government that the European Union expects Turkey to give a firm undertaking that it will take action to implement these reform objectives.
As a possible contribution to this, the Commission has proposed that the European Investment Bank grant Turkey a line of credit of EUR 450 million, to be used mainly to improve the competitiveness of the Turkish economy on the internal market.
I am delighted that you will be exchanging views on this question with your Turkish counterparts in the joint parliamentary committee next week.
I also welcome the proposals in this report on stepping up parliamentary cooperation and strengthening civil society.
Here we are talking about establishing a special programme to consolidate the Customs Union, extending the mandate of the European Investment Bank so that it can cover new loans to Turkey in the 2000-2004 period amounting to EUR 450 million.
Given that this special programme of EUR 450 million, of which the European Union is guaranteeing 65%, specifies that at a provisioning rate of 9 % only EUR 26 million will have to be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund, there will only be a budgetary impact in the event of a default, because in that case the guarantee would have to be called in.
With these loans from the European Investment Bank we are supporting investment in Turkish industry and in its infrastructures in terms of transport, energy and telecommunications.
The fundamental issue of Turkey' s accession continues to be a political issue and it is the responsibility of other parliamentary committees.
Customs Union and the loans from the European Investment Bank have been operating with Turkey for many years.
The aim now is to give the boost that is needed towards future accession.
I repeat that the only serious problems that we could have would occur if the macro-financial aid promised reached the maximum amount established, as in this hypothesis the residual reserve for guarantees would be reduced to practically zero for 2001 and 2002.
Let us remember that it is in the interests of the European Union to fund nuclear safety projects in third countries in the framework of Euratom.
A zero level of residual reserve could lead to definite problems in funding those investments.
The general situation that the report sets out is part of a situation of Parliament/Council negotiation for the 2001 budget, in which the European Parliament wishes to extend its rights to information and consultation in the case of external commitments by the Union that have a financial impact.
Even if Parliament is critical and even if Parliament is perhaps more critical than the Council and the Commission can ever be, we trust that Turkey will choose this way forward and will become a member of the European Union just as soon as it has put its house in order.
We will resist the efforts, some of them fairly spurious, to upset the balance the report successfully achieves, especially those amendments which seek to set up the European Parliament as a tribunal upon the past.
The Morillon report and the accession to partnership commit the European Union to Turkey's candidature.
In the first place, it is clear that the strategy of accepting Turkey' s candidature was the right one.
It was the correct strategy, as the Commissioner commented, because the debate which has taken place in Turkey today in order for it to become a member of the European Union is tantamount to a debate in favour of radical reform of the political situation in the country.
On this subject we have to tell Turkey that its refusal to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg cannot be tolerated.
Turkey must without further ado fall in line with the rulings of the European Court of Justice as a token of acceptance of international relations as defined by us, and not just by them.
Some are in favour of the candidature and the accession of Turkey, and want this candidature to involve a radical reform of Turkish society.
Turkish society obviously perceives this contradictory attitude.
There is another matter, and if we have to vote on it today, the majority of my Group will vote in favour of this resolution.
I am not certain, personally, that this is a useful move, because I wish to take the debate to Turkey.
In other words, I propose that the European Parliament should itself hold a debate on the Armenian genocide, the majority will follow on and we shall continue the debate in Turkey.
Mr Morillon, in my view, your report is an exceptionally realistic and responsible report.
We have indeed seen a number of interesting symbolic acts on the part of the Turkish Government since the Helsinki Council resolution several months ago.
However, nothing has been done to change the horrendous situation in Turkish jails, discrimination against the Kurds or Turkey's policy on Cyprus.
Turkey's membership on this basis, rather than for the geo-strategic reasons put forward by the USA or NATO, would enrich the European Union and represent a significant step towards a united Europe.
In my experience - the experience, I may add, of a life which knows just as much about radical social change as the refusal to recognise the need for it in time -, there is no substitute for critical candour.
But, in my book, the Commission report is a real step backwards.
Europe' s borders are now peaceful but, if Turkey does one day join the European Union, Europe will have a new border; not just an extra-European border, but a border of war and conflict.
Lastly I do not feel that questions have been asked concerning the size of the actual population represented by Turkey' s candidacy and the difficulties that this will cause, not only in terms of the Union' s geography but especially in terms of the already delicate balance between large, medium-sized and small Member States.
I shall conclude as I began: the idea and purpose of my speech have been to draw attention to the fact that changes on this scale should not take place without a democratic, ongoing debate, otherwise the deficit in citizenship and participation that many Europeans feel with regard to the model of European construction will continue to grow.
Mr President, the Morillon report in itself provides a perfect illustration of the basic contradictions in the European attitude to Turkey.
So the only real preamble which we should all be bound by is a recital taking into consideration the obvious facts of the situation.
Turkey must not, therefore, join the European Union.
We cannot play about with the dignity of nations.
We shall therefore vote against this report, just as we have voted against all the reports seeking to make Turkey a member of the European Union.
Mr President, is Turkey really ready to solve internal and overseas problems such as the conflict over Cyprus and the minorities issue, to the satisfaction of the European Union?
Turkey' s former Foreign Minister, Mümtaz Soysal, recently put this pressing question.
Mr President, with your permission I would like to briefly take up three fundamental points in Mr Morillon' s report: the political influence exerted by the Turkish army, the Kurdish question and the aspect referred to earlier of 'tolerance for other religions and cultures' .
The problems are so serious as to preclude Turkey's accession in the foreseeable future.
We aim to help Turkey become a free democratic country in which the rule of law prevails.
I would stress that in entrusting this huge power of monitoring the European databases to a monocratic body - notwithstanding the total respect and confidence which we have in the Guarantor - we would appear to have momentarily shifted our focus from the central concern of the human person which, in respect of the power of information technology, must be provided with a reference framework of guaranteed rights and freedoms.
In my opinion, the proposal to establish a collegiate body would have responded better to this need.
What is more, it does not go so far as the French legislation on computer technology and freedoms.
Finally, citizens must be given the means to protect their own privacy themselves by allowing a free choice of encryption in data transmission.
I welcome this report and will vote for it.
Duff/Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325/2000) Madam President, how could the Pensioners' Party not vote for the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
It is the first document of such importance in the whole world to contain an article - Article 25 - entitled 'The rights of the elderly', which reads: "the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life" .
The Charter therefore has no binding force upon countries whose legislation does not go quite so far as the minimum contained in the Charter.
In countries whose legislation is more favourable to workers, however, the Charter may be cited to oppose the national legislation in courts of law.
Madam President, I did not take part in the vote on the Charter of Fundamental Rights because I do not agree with the procedure: Parliament has been unable to propose any amendments either to the text of the Charter or even to the text of the recommendation.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a far cry from the Declaration of Human Rights of the UN, the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutions of many Member States of the European Union.
Those who dreamed up this Charter are banking on using this weighty document to pursue their aggressive policy against everything the working classes have fought, sacrificed and died for over the past 150 years.
The rights contained in the Charter are already included in national constitutions and safeguarded by national parliaments close to the nations of Europe and their cultures.
Moreover, the Charter is a compromise based on the lowest common denominator, which will be detrimental to social advantages acquired by law in a good number of European Member States.
The right to housing, for example, has been reduced to the right to "housing assistance" , while the right to work has been replaced by the "right of access to placement services" .
Articles establishing new obligations without justification.
Article 19(1), for example, states that "Collective expulsions are prohibited" but does not specify that this ban may be suspended in the event of war or serious internal public order disturbances.
As a third example of this, Article 45 states that "Freedom of movement and residence may be granted to nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State" , even though the law to this effect, as contemplated by Article 62 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, is not currently in force, and perhaps never will be if the conditions are not met.
This applies particularly to the economic and social rights listed in Chapter IV of the Charter.
Article 24, on the rights of the child, even fails to say, once again in spite of our requests, that every child has the right to live with his or her parents.
For instance, the new requirement for non-discrimination on grounds of language, found in Articles 21 and 22, contradicts the French Constitution which stipulates that the language of the Republic of France is French.
Articles obfuscating or distorting the Charter.
In the same vein, I have mentioned 52(2) which claims that the meaning and scope of the rights in the Charter shall be the same as those in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Ratifying the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms would be one of the most ambitious steps ever taken by the European Union.
The Charter will involve the European Court of Justice in a number of political decisions, in fields as diverse as employment law, extradition policy, immigration and the family.
The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.
Human rights are already respected in the EU, and safeguarded by national constitutional provisions according to the different customs of the Member States.
The debate on this Charter has been eagerly applauded by EU federalists who wish to see it as the beginning of a constitution for the European Union.
It is in danger of undermining the Council of Europe' s work on human rights and of leading to a situation in which human rights are dealt with in different ways in European countries in the future.
It is an extremely positive outcome both for the French Presidency of the European Union and for the European Parliament.
We must ensure that the existing rights flowing from the European Convention on Human Rights, and supported by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, are not diminished or brought into confusion.
The debate on this Charter has been eagerly applauded by EU federalists who wish to see it as the beginning of a constitution for the European Union.
It is in danger of undermining the Council of Europe' s work on human rights and of leading to a situation in which human rights are dealt with in different ways in European countries in the future.
Article 17 very reticently states that "the use of property may be regulated" in the general interest.
There is, however, no mention of social obligations relating to the right to property.
However, what worries us most is that the twin-track jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights will give rise to inconsistent case law, resulting in the unequal treatment of citizens in these sensitive areas, in breach of their fundamental rights.
The original idea behind the Convention was to have a text adopted by consensus which could subsequently be made binding by the fifteen Member State governments when it was incorporated into the Treaties.
If citizens are to feel involved in the European Union, its policies and institutions, then it is up to the Members of Parliament in particular to disclose more of the critical decisions, the contradictions, the divergent interests and projects driving the economic and social operators within the European arena.
We need better European legislation to improve the quality of life for all and to improve social welfare systems.
There is no right to work, just the "right to engage in work" ; there is no right to social protection or accommodation, just "the right to social assistance and housing assistance" ; there is no right to a retirement pension or a minimum income; there is no ban on redundancies, just the "right to protection against unjustified dismissal" .
Given that only have two options, my decision is unequivocally to vote in favour of the step forward which this Charter represents, however small that step forward may be in terms of the content and scope of the text.
At this time when debate in the institutions of Europe is being undertaken concomitantly with the Charter being adopted, all those men and women who, like myself, would like a European constitution and consider that this Charter may serve as the bare bones for the preamble to such a constitution should demand that the European Parliament be enabled to vote on the content, as part of its normal parliamentary business, which is basically deliberative.
This is therefore the first priority: we must give this Charter real legal force.
Secondly, the right to work is not directly stated.
The difference between not prohibiting access to work and taking action to make it possible to work is more than just a shade of meaning.
The Charter should have clearly stated the right to work, and indeed the right to housing, which was also expressed in a roundabout way, affording little protection.
The Charter must be improved, and the European Parliament must propose a strategy enabling it to be updated and enriched. .
In addition, it is confusing from the legal perspective, as a result of which the powers of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are in competition with those of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Unless it is amended in such a way as to shift the emphasis to social fundamental rights and the environment, I will be unable to vote in favour of adopting the Charter. . (DE) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is an important step towards defining the general, common values of the European Union.
It has already been assumed that the Charter might form the basis for a European constitution.
That makes including fundamental social rights even more important. 2.
It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice; on the contrary, the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter.
I voted for the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a declaration of intent.
There will be no shift in the balance of power between the EU and Member States.
We are very familiar with the position held by the majority in this Parliament.
We understand their position when they try to give a qualitatively diverse political meaning to a text on fundamental rights, which is not only vague and all-encompassing, but is also going to be of arguable usefulness in an EU that has no serious shortcomings, either in the legal status of its rights or in the way in which these rights are defended and implemented.
The great political debate on the Charter will therefore take place firstly between national governments and then, eventually, when this Parliament is confronted with their decision.
In the debate in this chamber today, regarding the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights, the Commission representative stated that this Charter was a first step toward a legally binding document.
These statements confirm the concerns expressed within my country that this Charter is intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution.
Established as "a body" by the Cologne Summit, it declared itself a "Convention" , a name with unfortunate connotations of 1793 when the French Revolution degenerated into the Reign of Terror under another "Convention" .
The basic right to a nation, which was also demanded and which is also fundamental, was also censored.
Ultimately there is nothing European about the text of the Charter.
As it stands, it could be adopted by just about any country in the whole world.
The value of the content of such an exercise, quite apart from its illegitimacy, given that the European Union has no jurisdiction in the field of human rights, cannot clearly be seen since, in Europe, our freedoms are protected remarkably well by the founding texts of our nations and by the European Convention on Human Rights.
Pensioners are in favour of strengthening criminal law, European law especially, as well as national law, for I am afraid that crimes are no longer committed solely by our citizens but by people of other nationalities as well.
These texts have two points in common.
Firstly, they are mutually complementary, extending Europol' s competence, setting up a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit, improving reciprocal assistance in judicial matters between Member States and defining more clearly the conditions for the fight against money laundering which is the result, or the cause, or in any case a necessary component in a great many very serious crimes.
Next, these texts are all based on initiatives by Member States, coming under either the third pillar of Article 67 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, where the Commission does not have the monopoly on the right of initiative.
Moreover, it is developing forms of cooperation that give greater respect to national sovereignty, as is shown by the initiative of the French Republic dealt with in the Roure report, which manages to reconcile mutual assistance in judicial matters and respect for the key interests of the Member States.
We supported these initiatives in general, except where the European Parliament amendments were tending to introduce too much of a federalist bias.
The arguments put forward by the European Parliament are completely fallacious.
The fact is, this House wishes to interfere with everything but draws the line at supporting the decisions which nonetheless lie at the heart of the responsibilities of States in order to protect their own peoples.
The Council' s common position has not been officially recognised.
The report under discussion today is a direct result of the commitment made at the European Council in Tampere, in October 1999, to combat this scourge of money laundering which amounts to between 2 and 5% of the world' s GDP every year.
We have had proposals, firstly, to extend Europol' s competence to cover money laundering - the Karamanou report - and, secondly, for a raft of measures to improve international cooperation in the field of mutual assistance in criminal matters - the Roure report.
The Marinho report now seeks to extend the principle of the mutual recognition of national measures for the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime, established by the Joint Action 98/699/JHA in 1998, to decisions in the pre-court phase, especially those enabling the competent authorities to take rapid action to obtain evidence and seize easily transportable assets.
I welcome this report.
Special action against money laundering was proposed in Tampere in 1999.
The right to property appears almost to be sacrosanct.
It sometimes seems as though this objective takes precedence over the fight against white-collar crime.
In practice, such cooperation could primarily be deployed, once in a while, for purposes other than the fight against money laundering.
Money laundering feeds the trade in drug-trafficking.
We welcome the French Presidency's initiative aimed at improving cooperation between national authorities responsible for tackling money laundering and laying down uniform penalties.
All Member States should treat money laundering as a criminal offence carrying a minimum sentence of four years' imprisonment.
This will be an important tool in allowing criminals to be tried across Europe.
These measures drafted by Socialist MEPs are an important step in combating international crime and I urge the House to support these reports.
Karamanou Report (A5-0312/2000) Madam President, I voted for the Karamanou report, whose objective is also of major importance: the creation of a European Police Office.
However, it is vital that national parliaments and the European Parliament have access to information on Europol's activities in order to ensure political accountability and that there is a role for the European Court to ensure judicial accountability.
We also support the future establishment of a convention to help combat organised crime and money laundering, and the various measures proposed in order to achieve those purposes.
The idea of creating an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe is, obviously, an aspiration that we share.
We feel that the strict limitation of the reasons for which the Member States may refuse to provide judicial cooperation solely to "essential interests," thus excluding the notions of sovereignty, public order and national security in force up until now is a step forward, but is still inadequate.
This is mainly because we still find it unacceptable for a State to be able to invoke a "general interest" in order to be able to deny judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
This shows, once again, that the Member States have a long way to go in understanding the meaning of shared sovereignty.
Moreover, I should point out, as a Member representing Basques and Catalans, that there continues to be an emphasis on cooperation between States, without taking into account that in the EU other police forces operate that are not State bodies.
This report and, in general, the area of freedom, safety and justice in Europe, is based on democracy and on the rule of law that should reign in the EU.
Therefore, what most concerns me about the future of legal cooperation in the EU is that currently some States are proposing criminal reforms that are bordering on the violation of human rights.
Specifically, this special legislation is considering sentences of up to ten years in prison for children of 14 years of age, not to mention other measures.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that Europe needs to construct the area of freedom, security and justice that we so often cite in our speeches.
The draft convention proposes that banking secrecy may not be used as a reason to refuse a request from another Member State for information on somebody suspected of being involved in financial crime.
Gebhardt Report (A5-0317/2000) Madam President, this is a document - which I voted for - which is intended to establish gradually, step by step, a European public prosecution service.
In fact, a provisional cooperation unit is being set up, composed of a representative of the judges or police officers with equivalent competence from each of our 15 Member States.
However, I would have hoped that this body would also have included representatives of the lawyers of each of the 15 States, for I feel that, at a time when we have to establish something new in the legal area, it would be beneficial to consult not only the judges who judge but also the lawyers, who have a great deal of experience in the field.
Nor will such a system be able to solve the problems faced by the Member States.
I should like today to highlight Mr Morillon's call for a European-Turkish discussion forum in the House and for a debate on Turkey's accession prospects in the national parliaments in our Member States.
The initial euphoria of the Council and Commission has clearly waned.
Consequently, there is even more need now, almost one year on from Helsinki, for Turkey's accession prospects to be debated in our national parliaments and with our citizens.
When the EIB grants loans to countries other than the Member States, Parliament ought also to be consulted about the political priorities to be set in what is a part of the Bank' s activity mainly motivated by foreign policy.
The Kemalist ideology that was modern in 1930 is not so in 2000.
Hence my amendments on the need for a political solution for the Kurdish people.
I hope Parliament and the Council will remedy that omission.
Until there is a solution for the Kurds there will be no fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and I therefore call upon Parliament to pass my amendments, and on the Council and Parliament to insist that a solution for the Kurds is a key to unlocking the problems of Turkey fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
While there is a special relationship between Azerbaijan and Turkey, this is far from being the case for Armenia, a country against which Turkey is maintaining a commercial blockade, which is not acceptable in a country which has been accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union.
In this context, I would like to reiterate the basic conclusion in paragraph 22 that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria and draw attention both to the fact that Turkey has been condemned on numerous occasions for acts and omissions in relation to human rights, democratic freedoms and its international attitude and to the European Parliament's recommendations that Turkey comply with the relevant European values.
On the other hand, although paragraphs 9, 10, 12 and 17 expressly refer to infringements of these values by Turkey on numerous occasions, especially by the Turkish occupying army in Cyprus, which Turkey is called on to withdraw, the fact remains that it would have been preferable to roundly condemn Turkey's present and past responsibility for problems caused by its intransigence and the resultant impasse on the Cyprus question - where, it should be noted, there are clear signs of Turkey's intention to provoke a new heated crisis -, its failure to abide by international conventions with its expansionist policy towards Greece, its concealment of the historical truth of the Armenian genocide and its disregard for the fundamental minority rights of the Kurds.
This is the first serious step on the road towards Turkey's accession and the accession process can now move into the practical application stage.
I find them unseemly, ill-advised, untimely and inappropriate because these are amendments which use three words - "genocide", "Muslim" and "Asian" - in a way that is racist, derogatory and discriminatory and which causes impenetrable and false barriers to be erected against Turkey's accession to the Union.
Indeed, the UN Convention of 1948 has not been broadened to include the Armenian tragedy.
I welcome Turkey's careful progress towards the Union and I support the Commission and the Morillon report.
The Turkish parliamentarian, Leyla Zana, winner of the Sakharov Prize, and in prison since 1995 merely for haven spoken in Kurdish within the Turkish Parliament, is still languishing in prison.
Mr President, Paragraph 17 of Mr Morillon' s report states that the European Parliament 'calls on the Turkish Government to withdraw its occupation forces from northern Cyprus' .
Almost 40 per cent of Cyprus is occupied by foreign troops in the form of Turkish soldiers.
This means that, as a democratic state under the rule of law with separation of powers and fundamental values as we understand them, Turkey will enrich the European Union.
Turkey will become an essentially democratic country once it learns to live with its past, just as democratic Germany has learned to live with its past - we asked the same of it.
Mr President, I should like to offer General Morillon my warmest congratulations on his report, in which he has combined perceptiveness with clarity.
As you all know, our group was highly sceptical about Turkey's candidate status but we are delighted, now that Turkey has candidate status, that it is on the ball and has decided to engage in a process of reform in order to meet the demands of the European Union.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak in this debate in my capacity as the author of the report on the accession of Cyprus.
Since both Turkey and Cyprus are candidates for membership of the European Union, it is increasingly clear that a solution to the Cypriot question is becoming a matter of internal policy.
Commission Verheugen has confirmed that the Cyprus issue plays a very important part in the discussions currently being conducted with Turkey.
Paragraph 17 of our motion for a resolution explicitly calls for this.
One of the three conditions stipulated in the Morillon report, a condition that the European Parliament will be adopting, would still remain unfulfilled.
Mr President, there is much in this resolution on Turkey's progress towards accession which is commendable - in particular the call to the Commission to implement a properly resourced pre-accession strategy.
Of course peoples of Kurdish origins as well as other cultural and linguistic minorities must not be subjected to political, economic or other discrimination and must have the opportunity to express themselves freely, but this expression should be through entirely peaceful means and without intimidation and terrorism.
We should also be clear that the resolution of extraordinarily difficult problems such as Cyprus, which requires the assent of all the people of Cyprus, will not be helped by frustrating Turkish progress towards accession.
In other words, we are talking about increasing the degree to which Turkey is subject to the economic, political and military objectives of big business in the European Union.
There are also positive references to Cyprus, with the call for the occupying forces to be withdrawn, to the need to implement the decisions of the European court, as in the Loïzidou case, to the need for a political solution to the Kurdish question and to the bombings in Iraq.
For us, the basic issue is this: despite numerous allegations to the contrary, not only has Turkey failed to improve the standard of living of its people, in certain sectors it has made it worse since customs union in 1995 and the declaration of candidate status in 1999.
A number of speakers have expressed their concerns regarding the human rights situation and the treatment of minorities, particularly the Kurdish question, the heavy involvement of the military in political life, the legal system and capital punishment, all of which are very serious issues.
We can but share these concerns, which were duly expressed by the Commission in its last annual report.
President Sezer has made a personal commitment to the process of modernisation in his country.
The strategy adopted in Helsinki last December marked a turning point in relations between the European Union and Turkey.
It is within this balanced framework that we shall have to resolutely continue our work to promote rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey.
So, in conclusion, let me say: let us be demanding, let us be vigilant, let us set our terms but, let us not be excessive in our demands, as we too must live up to our commitments and the European Union made an important decision in Helsinki.
Mr President, I should like to close the debate by pointing out that there is, of course, a link between the Commission report on the progress that has been made, or not made, in Turkey and the accession partnership.
The accession partnership per se is a very balanced document, based largely on the Helsinki conclusions.
We are at the proposal stage and I am not in a position this afternoon to tell you if this project will get beyond the proposal stage, especially if Parliament endorses proposals made here this morning and this afternoon.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing me to give an assessment of the current state of the European Union' s Mediterranean policy since this is, as you know, the eve of the Fourth Conference of Foreign Ministers from the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which is to be held in Marseilles.
It is, moreover, the reason for our insistence on drawing up an assessment of the results of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, in order to be in a position, in Marseilles, to establish the necessary guidelines.
Mr Brok referred to the common strategy on the Mediterranean Region, adopted in Feira in June.
This, however, unlike the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which unites the Fifteen Member States with twelve partners on the southern coast of the Mediterranean, is an instrument for discipline within the Union, to some extent, designed to intensify the coherence and coordination of all Community instruments and Member State policies with regard to the Mediterranean region.
Priorities for the implementation of this common strategy have already been established by the Presidency and were presented to the Council of Ministers in September.
The Presidency strove particularly to identify areas on which the European Union and its partners of the southern Mediterranean should concentrate their efforts in order to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, particularly by intensifying political and economic dialogue, improving the effectiveness of Community aid, the implementation of sub-regional cooperation and South-South integration, and even intensifying initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs.
This is indeed also our objective for the Marseilles Conference.
Indeed, when we instigated the partnership in 1995, we were aware that we were undertaking a long-term project.
There was plainly nothing easy about the task of bringing together, overnight, 27 partners as diverse as this against an often tense, and occasionally more than tense political background and within a framework as original as the Barcelona arrangement.
You may rest assured that we fully intend to continue in this way.
And even if it is true that the economic aspect of Barcelona is the one that, despite the delays, is working best, the main thing is that we must not lose sight of this overall approach, without which the process would be consigned to being nothing more than just another free trade area, lacking in political or human vision in the long term and this would be unfortunate.
Our Mediterranean partners are our direct neighbours.
Great prospects are opening up, too, for cooperation in the areas of combating trafficking of all sorts, migration and enhancing the rule of law.
It is furthermore in our own interests to support our partners in their process of structural reforms, upgrading and opening up their economies to competition.
The challenges are such, the needs of the southern countries are so great that the resources of the European Union will always appear to be inadequate, especially since the external commitments of the Union have increased to an extraordinary degree in the last few years.
This is a debate which, as you know, we have had several times in the Council; a debate which I think I can say lies at the heart of the reform undertaken on the initiative of Commissioner Patten.
The fact remains that the Council, particularly since 1995, has striven to allocate more extensive resources to the Mediterranean region, appropriate to the challenges of the partnership.
Since 1995 the French Presidency has made particular efforts in this regard, especially at the European Council in Cannes, where we succeeded in restoring balance between the funding for Mediterranean policy and that properly allocated to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
This is the spirit in which the MEDA I programme was launched with EUR 3.4 billion committed between 1995 and 1999.
We have already managed to agree on the arrangements for the MEDA II financial regulation.
I feel that the instrument we shall have in future will be more effective, more speedy, more transparent and therefore, ultimately, more credible.
I feel that with an allocation of several billion euros for the Mediterranean region over the period 2000-2007, we shall be in a position to fulfil the expectations of our partner countries in the South over the next few years, and that is crucial.
In fact, it is no longer just a matter, as it was in 1995, of restoring balance with Eastern Europe, but also of making ready for the future enlargement of the European Union.
In our opinion, this is one more reason to emphasise the Mediterranean dimension of a European Union that wishes to be an actor on the world stage and for which the Mediterranean region must and shall continue to be the 'uniting sea' or in Latin the 'mare nostrum' .
I should like expressly to thank the French Presidency of the Council for endeavouring to give the necessary momentum to the Barcelona process.
We in central Europe must understand that the debate on the Barcelona process is in our common interest, just as we expect southern Europeans to understand that enlargement to central and eastern Europe is in our common interest.
Naturally, we hope that Mr Patten's concept will succeed and that the Commission will be able to implement these projects more quickly than has been the case in the past.
With proper economic and social prospects in place, there is a good chance of implementing human rights and democratising the community of states in the region.
The worrying developments which we have witnessed in many states in North Africa in the past and, in fact, are still witnessing today, also come under this heading and I hope that we shall manage to bring all the countries of North Africa on board in this process without any whys and wherefores.
The current situation in the Middle East is making abundantly clear what measures are needed in the form of joint policies and cooperation.
I think that the European Union has a special role to play here and that the countries and the people in these regions are waiting for the European Union to exert its political influence because it can bring balance and credibility to bear there.
I trust that the fact that this political influence is expected and we are expected to play a part there will help to get things moving in Marseilles and provide the necessary credibility, allowing us to make a contribution to peace in this region and enhance our own stability.
In the temporary, but wholly understandable, absence of my honourable friend at the beginning of this debate I was tempted to say that this would be like Hamlet without the prince, but I am delighted that he is with us in order to contribute his wisdom and good sense to this extremely important debate which is taking place at the honourable Member's initiative.
Many of us were delighted, even surprised, by the extent of the progress which seemed to have been made this summer at Camp David and we gave a great deal of applause to President Clinton and his administration for all they had done to move things forward.
Nobody would seek to deny that the Barcelona process and the Middle East peace process are interconnected.
The breakthrough in Euro-Mediterranean relations at Barcelona was made possible partly by the breakthrough at Madrid and then the Oslo Accords.
We must not allow the Barcelona process to become a hostage to the Middle East peace process.
The Commission has been encouraged by the generally positive reaction to the proposals that we set out on reinvigorating the Barcelona process, both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners.
We in fact completed our negotiations with Egypt almost 18 months ago and I wish that we could now rapidly proceed to initialling the agreement and then in due course to full signature.
I would also like to see us commencing more serious negotiations on association agreements with the other countries.
We want to see the bringing together of policies on single market issues and agreement to introduce cumulation of origin side-by-side with the sub-regional free trade arrangements for all partners entering into free trade with each other and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.
Reaching agreement on a new regional programme on justice and home affairs covering migration in the widest sense, the fight against organised crime and cooperation on judicial matters is another subject on which we hope we can have a good exchange of views.
The revision of the MEDA regulation and the reform already announced of the Commission's external aid system will help to achieve this and will also lead to more human resources being available.
As far as human rights are concerned, we propose a structural approach looking at the performance of countries over time.
A country which has serious doubts raised about its record on human rights, democracy and the rule of law and is not prepared to discuss these matters transparently will not find it easy to fit into the new world pattern and it will be less likely to prosper in the longer term.
I just want to say one more thing about MEDA and the reform of our external aid which is relevant to debates which Members are having elsewhere.
In order to ensure that we deliver more rapidly in the Mediterranean and elsewhere in the world, we need - as Members accept rationally and intellectually - more resources to actually manage our programmes and the Commission has put forward what are sensible proposals for doing that.
There are some Members who think that we should put those extra resources into the reserve until we have accomplished certain other objectives.
I say to Members of Parliament, in all good faith, that there comes a moment when you have to trust us and when you have to let us try to do the job, because we cannot conceivably implement our plans more effectively if the people we need to manage them are not made amiable until we have actually demonstrated that we can manage things more effectively.
It is an issue which is extremely important to all the Mediterranean countries and I hope I will be able to assure them this week that it is our firm intention to do a great deal better in the delivery of our programmes in future.
I hope that all the Ministers who gather in Marseilles will recognise the need to agree on this set of realistic proposals to reinvigorate the Barcelona process precisely now that the Middle East is suffering serious difficulties.
We have committed in the past huge resources to this partnership.
We have not managed them as well as we should have done but we have committed huge resources and that reflects the priority which Parliament, the Commission and the Council give to strengthening the partnership around our "middle sea".
We welcome with great satisfaction the news that the Commission intends to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process.
However, we feel that the events taking place in this area bordering on the European Union are extremely important and that we need the undertakings and proposals outlined by Commissioner Patten just now to be more effectively implemented than has been the case in recent years.
Therefore, should the financial provisions intended for the regions in question be changed, as the European Parliament has requested, how will the Commission adapt its interventions?
Mr President, five years on from the Barcelona Conference, it is time to take stock of the situation.
Last March, the European Parliament approved a resolution which made a critical analysis of the policies and instruments of the Partnership, proposing some substantial changes.
In June 2000, the Feira Council adopted a common Mediterranean strategy and, after proposing and obtaining endorsement for reform of the Meda regulation, the Commission recently tabled a document on reinvigorating the Barcelona Process.
Nevertheless, the process which commenced in Barcelona, based on three pillars - political, economic and cultural - was subject to three constraints, now generally well recognised, and Commissioner Patten touched upon them in his speech.
I have stressed these aspects because they contain the key to reinvigorating the Process, and the enhancement of the Barcelona political agenda must be added to all this.
As regards agriculture, I would like to point out that Parliament has undertaken to organise a conference next spring.
In fact, the Council's common strategy followed this line.
On the other hand, the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which is to open tomorrow in Marseilles, is set against the backdrop of a tragic situation which will make Europe's role in the region even more sensitive and lead the Union to assume a more substantial political role in the Israel-Palestine conflict.
The fact that, despite this situation, the 27 partners have confirmed their willingness to meet in Marseilles, at least for the moment, is already in itself an indication that all is not lost, although I agree entirely with Commissioner Patten that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership policy must not become a hostage to the peace process.
The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party obviously supports the Commission' s actions in favour of a Mediterranean policy, as outlined five years ago in Barcelona, and we want it to be consolidated.
Our priority must therefore be to ensure the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort to achieve this cooperation and to ensure that the funds allocated are used efficiently, according to what we might call the selfish generosity of the European Union.
Mr President, we presented the MEDA report at the beginning of September, and while this report, admittedly, allowed us to note some shortcomings, it was also, more importantly, an opportunity to proclaim loud and clear the determination of both this House and the Commission in Euro-Mediterranean matters.
Commissioner Patten, I read your article in today' s issue of Le Monde.
The fact, moreover, that we carried the motion in this House, with the enormous majority of 502 votes in favour and a paltry 17 against, shows that we are all unanimously in favour of renewing and boosting the Euro-Mediterranean Process.
There are a number of points I would like to clarify, now that the Marseilles Conference is about to take place, in order to ensure that we get some answers, as it is not enough to repeat ritualistic phrases, given that we are all in agreement.
It seems that at least EUR 1 billion is needed annually, but for the moment this sum has not been allocated, and at the same time there is talk of EUR 200 million to be taken, supposedly, from the margin relating to appropriations for Kosovo and Serbia.
The forum that was held in Marseilles on 12 November made that quite clear.
Next, we must increase the amount of appropriations for regional development in order to encourage relations and trade between regions, but also environmental protection, the fight against terrorism and drugs trafficking, emigration and integration, and to make progress towards human rights, as we have requested.
Mr President, Commissioner, I share the determination which has been expressed to give a new boost to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership forthwith.
The peoples of the South are often critical and are concerned about this failure.
I share their impatience, and even their disappointment and their anger, at the delays but also at the inadequacies of this partnership and at the initial damage it has caused.
There are still extreme disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, which keep the peoples of the South in an explosive economic and social situation, with poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people.
The path leading to an area of shared prosperity has, for the time being, stopped at the association agreements, which are governed by strictly economic and financial interests in denial of the needs of the people.
The spiralling violence in the Middle East, the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the Palestinian people, whose right to statehood is still being denied by Israel, are all threatening the future of the entire region.
These last few days in Marseilles, I have observed the great numbers of speakers addressing such comments to the Conference of Ministers, speaking in favour of cancelling debt and replacing free trade with relations of mutually supportive codevelopment... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, the different areas of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue must, in my opinion, be tackled from the social, political and cultural perspectives, in continuation of that process - the Euro-Mediterranean Conference - which was set in motion in Barcelona in 1995 when we first started to talk about Mediterranean policy, although the complexity of the subject caused some difficulties even then.
This is prompting the Europe of national States to form a single political, economic and commercial entity in order to organise and boost a market of over 350 million consumers and set it on a level with other markets.
Europe's economic progress is now under threat from the current globalisation process, and our continent is in serious danger of a recession caused by competition from South-East Asia - where the cost of labour is a tenth of the cost of labour in Europe - the USA and Japan.
The Mediterranean policy is now operating in a world of extremely varied interests and latent stabilisation, and it must therefore include certain elements such as the development of peace-keeping initiatives - but it must not, I would stress, be limited to this - and the creation of partnership projects which involve northern and southern Europe, precisely because the objective of making the Mediterranean an area of dialogue, tolerance and cooperation and a guarantee of peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will or without the lasting, well-balanced social and economic development of less-favoured peoples and the social development of the coastal peoples, improving their employment possibilities, in order to put an end to the multitude of problems caused by the tremendous number of emigrants leaving the Basin and now affecting all the countries of the Union.
Mr President, in Nice the European Union will need to strike a balance between integration and enlargement and in Marseilles it will need to strike a balance between its function in central Europe and its responsibility in the Mediterranean.
We need to set priorities; in other words, we need to use the enlargement process to strengthen Europe from the centre outwards and force a stabilisation process in south-east Europe and in the western Balkans, but without neglecting the Barcelona process, which has been drifting for five years now.
With these conditions in place, it should be possible for the special council in Marseilles to reach a consensus which does more than just highlight the fault lines in the EU.
Mr President, tomorrow and the following day the Euro-Mediterranean Conference is to be held in Marseilles, attended by all the countries that signed the Barcelona Declaration, and I think that we can congratulate ourselves on this.
However, in all the evaluations that are now being made of five years of the Barcelona process, many people think that we can be satisfied simply that the process is continuing, due to the fact that there have been ministerial meetings attended by representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon, etc.
The evaluation is now a contrasting one and, of course, the strategic development of Euro-Mediterranean policy cannot depend on a temporary evaluation.
It is continuity over time that can provide results, and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
Those countries come up against a great deal of problems finding a place for their development and economic integration in the context of globalisation and we must do everything in our power to help restore balance to a situation characterised by gulfs between North and South.
Above all, we need to avoid having to make an evaluation of the application of MEDA in five years' time that leads us to conclude that only 26% have been used.
The second is an essential policy dealing with the human aspect of managing migration flows.
The third is discussion and the quest for progress and consensus in developing a common agricultural policy in the Mediterranean, without which we will probably not be able to achieve a positive outcome in the medium term.
However, we must not ignore the fact that the Barcelona Process has entered a critical stage, caused not only by lack of impetus or a slow down in the European undertaking in respect of the events in the Balkans or enlargement, but also by the conditions of tragic open conflict in the Mediterranean which are holding back reinvigoration.
I hope that when the Conference of Ministers of the Union meets in Marseilles, it will be able to adopt a position on this matter which is coherent with what is always pompously stressed, that human rights must not be violated.
Mr President, since the Barcelona conference and now on the eve of the Marseilles conference, as has already been said, a great deal has taken place in the Mediterranean region.
It is true that this Conference is going to take place in a context of violence and of a peace crisis as a result of the conflict in the Middle East, but it is also true that holding the conference will enable us to keep the flame of the Euro-Mediterranean process burning and that it should not be contaminated by the tragic conflict.
Now more than ever we need to proclaim that only regional cooperation, dialogue with civil society, economic and cultural exchange, solidarity and mutual understanding can make the two shores of the Mediterranean a prosperous and peaceful area.
It is a warning call to the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean area, which historically and culturally has enriched our European continent.
Let us make borders a real filter for crime and criminals, and not a barrier to development, culture or the prosperity of peoples.
The European Union needs a new culture of immigration and a better management of migration flows.
The European Union is jointly responsible, with the countries of origin, for immigration and for organising those migration flows, which are so necessary for the development of the region.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day that passes is punctuated by developments in the current crisis in the Middle East and every day that passes is a further indication, as if this were needed, that everything that happens in the South and around the Mediterranean is of direct concern to us, and affects our daily lives.
Unfortunately, for many years, too, factors such as the enlargement of Europe to the East, the Balkans crisis and wars have displaced the South in the minds of a great many Europeans, hence the repeated delays in Mediterranean processes and policies.
The Commission and the Council claim to want this.
What is much more serious, however, at the very moment when we are calmly exchanging points of view, often very divergent ones, within this Chamber, more and more Palestinians are being killed.
The European Union must, as a matter of urgency, strongly condemn the Israeli attacks on the Palestinian people, whose demand to live in peace in their own state is a legitimate one and one which must, therefore, be met.
And I have seen that in all these documents on strengthening the Barcelona agreement we are forgetting some things.
One of them is that liberalisation, a single market, cannot be established without taking care of some important aspects, such as people and culture or education.
Europe needs to think outside the principle of subsidiarity or go beyond it and realise that it needs to provide a great deal of aid in order to raise the level in the recipient countries, among both men and women, not only of basic education but also of minimum education, which in Europe is considered to be for all citizens.
With the rise in crude oil prices there is going to be much more pressure on the Mediterranean.
Also, we cannot demand that European citizens properly implement their environmental policy and not apply this to other countries.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m.
As is known, a proposal was submitted back in May but we had to wait until September before there was a definitive proposal on the table.
This also means that the Commission' s new proposal was worth waiting for, because it sets out in clear and lucid terms how the European Commission proposes to deliver aid in future, both with regard to the general regulation for the Balkans and with regard to the proposal for the agency in Kosovo.
There is now a regulation on the table which, as I see it, equips the European Union to deliver aid in an efficient manner and on time, and to put EU funds to good use in the countries of the western Balkans.
In this way, and this is very important - I will come back to it again shortly - a good balance has been struck between the Commission' s responsibility on the one hand and the need to involve the Member States in some way, on the other.
However, there are two key aspects of policy I would like to focus on.
The first relates - and I am sorry to have to bother the Commissioner with this again - to the finances.
The fact that the European Union actually spends far more money but is nothing like as high profile, has led many people to conclude that there is a need to substantially raise people' s awareness of our activities in the Balkans.
Seen in a positive light, I sometimes think, and hope, that the agency, by the manner in which it has operated to date, and in which it is to function in the future, ought to serve as an example of how aid should be delivered to the Balkans, and also to other parts of the world.
The procedures involved are often too complex, but we must not turn a blind eye, nor must we want to - and I hope the Member States do not do so either - to their part in this.
Delivering aid to the Balkans within the framework of CARDS, to countries such as Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia, demands other special qualities and other capabilities.
Let us confine ourselves to this and not dissipate our energies by extending the agency' s capabilities beyond the borders of former Yugoslavia.
After the tragedy that the Balkans suffered, these fruits first appeared a few months ago in Croatia with free elections and a regime eager to respect human rights, and have now revealed themselves in Belgrade, where the citizens have confirmed their desire to live together in peace and freedom and to take their place in the family of Europe.
We must not disappoint them in their expectations, and now more than ever these countries need our help.
We must continue this process of stabilising the region and prepare them for a longer-term perspective of integration in the institutions of Europe.
In doing this, of course, we are staking our credibility and our own stability.
In addition, there are several measures - I am referring particularly to the CARDS programme - that should go beyond reconstruction and extend to training, education and the reconstruction of civil society in close collaboration with NGOs.
It is vital that NGOs should collaborate in this field, and also that there should be some coordination among them, if we really want their action to be more effective and to reach all parts of those regions.
The media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy they have been through, so it is essential to have a completely free media that acts in accordance with the rules that prevail in our democracies.
It is also very important to make the judiciary really independent.
Therefore it is important for the CARDS programme management committee to be a committee that confines itself to the general lines of multiannual planning and does not try to carry out everyday micro-management at too detailed a scale, because otherwise we may again have the same problems as in the past.
It is also essential to strengthen the role of the European Parliament, and I believe that with the amendments, which are likely to be voted for tomorrow, the European Parliament will be able to perform a greater consultative role in a process of interinstitutional collaboration.
We have to give more effective and more coordinated aid, gathering together all the scattered bits and pieces.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which I have the honour of chairing, has endeavoured, through its opinion, to emphasise the importance of this reconstruction work in the Balkans as a possible way of integrating these areas into Europe as a whole.
The fact that the amendments expressed as an opinion by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have been accepted and that unanimity has been achieved is, in my opinion, an important factor which this House should note and take into consideration.
Our work has borne fruit.
But I am also happy because I feel that Parliament has succeeded, by keeping the pressure on, in turning round a situation that originally left a great deal to be desired.
I then asked the Commission to withdraw the proposal.
I am currently working on a report on how funds are being spent in Bosnia Herzegovina.
It is a follow-up report to a special report by the Court of Auditors.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lagendijkand Westendorp reports on the Agency and the CARDS programme - it is difficult to distinguish one from the other - base their proposed amendments on the experience gained from their forerunners, the OBNOVA programme and the Kosovo agency.
I also feel that duplicate work by the governing board and management board and unnecessary ritual meetings of their members, where it is the director responsible who needs to take the necessary decisions on time, should be avoided.
I hope that Parliament's proposals will be accepted by the Commission and the Council.
As I understand it, the Commissioner also takes the view that this should be an important objective in the CARDS programme.
I really do hope that the French Minister for Education, Jacques Lang, will be able to persuade his cabinet to ensure that the French government does not oppose the inclusion of the objective of education in the CARDS programme in the next Coreper.
So my thanks to all my fellow members who see this as an important objective and I am delighted that we shall be able to bring these countries more in the way of content in the future.
Mr President, I wanted to make a number of general comments today about what I would like to call 'the political reconstruction of the Balkans region' .
A great deal of headway has been made in the space of a year and the internal dynamics in a number of countries are at long last enhancing the role of the international community, even though the Kosovo crisis is still fresh in the memory.
Naturally the all-important question is: what future does Kosovo have within Yugoslavia?
Perhaps the European Union could act as a mediator in this.
They have replaced three politicians who personified the worst aspects of former Yugoslavia in the nineties.
The government in Zagreb is helping us to think about the future of the region, and making real investments in democracy and stability.
Europe must clearly demonstrate that its aid is making a difference, even before the parliamentary elections in Serbia.
In the Bosnian part, the position of the nationalists has come under attack for the first time ever.
We must concentrate our energies in the physical reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, but this will only work if we manage to alter the people' s frame of mind too.
Those politicians who openly work for such a cause deserve not only our admiration, but above all, our support.
The stability of the region will depend on the extent to which the new leaders are able to keep the lid on the national spirit and develop a different kind of mentality.
The reports by Mr Westendorp and Mr Lagendijk provide the foundation we need for an efficient approach to the matter.
The aid has been too bureaucratic and too slow in coming, because the Commission has been too centralised and management-driven in its work.
There has been too much management in detail, and Parliament has been complicit in this on a number of points.
It is very unfortunate that there is no certainty regarding what we have by way of money for Serbia next year.
It is also unfortunate that a large number of programmes have been put in the so-called performance reserve.
Let us celebrate the visit by the elected Serbian president tomorrow by now seriously giving the Commission a chance to put the aid we offer onto a new and better footing.
Mr President, the aid which we are discussing is yet another instrument of foreign intervention in this highly sensitive region of Europe.
These events may well have created a climate of euphoria in leading imperialist circles; but they know full well that they have not subdued the spirit of resistance in the Yugoslavian or any other people.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the Western Balkans present a significant challenge for the European Union and the credibility of its foreign policy, due to the scale of our human, political and financial commitment in the region, and also our desire to facilitate stabilisation through the construction, development and finally reintegration of the Balkan region into the European family.
It continued with another major event in the form of the victory of democratic forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the fall of Milosevic.
We indeed hope that the year will end with the consolidation of democracy on 23 December during the parliamentary elections in Serbia.
It reacted immediately to the new order in Croatia, by undertaking the process that will lead, at the Zagreb summit on 24 November, in other words in ten days' time, to the opening of negotiations aimed at concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with this country.
Thinking ahead to the summit in Zagreb, we wanted to focus the Union' s action on consolidating democracy and evaluating the Stabilisation and Association Process.
We should like to highlight the value of the process, for example by marking the conclusion of negotiations of the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during the Zagreb Summit, or confirming an individual approach that is adapted to each country' s particular characteristics and, as I have already said, by outlining the prospects the process holds for each of us.
The summit will also aim to consolidate democracy in the FRY, support the process of reconciliation between these countries and neighbouring countries, and encourage the development of reliable cooperation between the countries in the region.
Therefore, the Union, without waiting for the Stabilisation and Association Agreements to be implemented, will remind the five countries concerned that it expects them, as of now, to conclude regional cooperation agreements between themselves.
Such agreements, that were provided for within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, should, in our view, include the initiation of political dialogue, a regional free trade area, as well as close collaboration in the field of justice and home affairs, in particular with a view to strengthening the judiciary and its independence in the fight against organised crime, corruption, money laundering and all other forms of criminal trafficking.
Any rapprochement with the European Union is, in fact, closely linked, in the eyes of the Council, to the development of regional cooperation.
Examination of the reports by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza and Mr Lagendijk on proposals for a Regulation concerning a framework programme on the one hand, and the European Agency for Reconstruction on the other, provide us with an opportunity to assess the scale of the support that the Union intends to give the Western Balkans in relation to the Stabilisation and Association Process.
The Presidency-in-Office, like you, would like this framework programme to implement the principles of the reform of the management of external aid: fewer procedures, greater coordination out in the field, fewer outstanding commitments.
Similarly, we support the extension to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of the activity of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which proved its effectiveness in Kosovo.
The Council Presidency aims to reach an agreement on the proposals for a Regulation regarding the CARDS programme and the European Agency for Reconstruction during the General Affairs Council at the end of November, in other words next week, so as to be able to make an announcement at Zagreb on 24 November.
This amount, which will include assistance for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will result from a unanimous decision regarding the way in which the EUR 10 billion available under the ceiling of heading 4 will be distributed between the two aid programmes, MEDA II and CARDS, the adoption of which will feature among our priorities.
Lastly, during the General Affairs Council on 18 September, the Presidency-in-Office adopted asymmetric commercial preferences for the benefit of those countries that are participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process.
These measures accord preferential access to the Community market for agricultural and industrial products produced by these countries.
The French Presidency set itself ambitious targets as regards the Western Balkans which are close to being achieved: the development of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the adoption of the CARDS programme, the adoption of asymmetric commercial preferences, to mention but the more noteworthy Community measures.
The long-awaited victory of democracy in Croatia, and then in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, forces the European Union, as we are well aware, to take things much further.
Mr President, my initial impression of President Kostunica is that he has been very pragmatic in his political dealings since he assumed power in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
He has consolidated his victory but has equally been tactful in his relations with other leaders in the region.
I hope that President Kostunica and his supporters will steadily consolidate their position as the new democratic leadership in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at all political levels.
Elections for the Serbian Parliament are scheduled to take place on 23 December.
I welcome the fact that President Kostunica has acknowledged the importance of cooperating with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
An invitation has been extended to President Kostunica to participate, as the new President of Yugoslavia, at the forthcoming Zagreb summit.
It is very important to assure the other Balkan participants that the return of Yugoslavia to the international community will in no way lessen their support from the European Union.
Other objectives of the Zagreb summit must include an announcement of the Community assistance and reconstruction, democratisation and stabilisation programmes for the Western Balkans, a confirmation of the progressive establishment of a free trading zone between the European Union and the Western Balkans and a commitment by the countries in the region for regional cooperation and to putting in place a free trading regime between them.
This is an important new objective in the CARDS programme.
The Commission is in favour and I should like very much to know if the Council is too.
Question Time (Council) The next item is Question Time (B5-0553/2000).
During the European Council, within the framework of the report on the development of European facilities for military and civilian crisis management, it was suggested that rapid financing mechanisms, such as the creation by the Commission of a rapid reaction fund, should be set up to speed up the provision of finance to support European Union activities, to contribute to operations run by other international organisations and to fund NGO activities, where appropriate.
It was first examined on 6 November.
The aim is to adopt a regulation as soon as possible but, in order to achieve this, the Council must have Parliament' s opinion in due form.
Mr President-in-Office, you want Parliament's opinion and we understand you propose taking a decision next month in December.
If I tell you that Parliament will be debating this in January, I should like to know if you will wait for our opinion before you take your decision?
I can only repeat what I said in the conclusion of my reply, namely that we aim to adopt a regulation as soon as possible, but, in order to do so, the Council has to have the European Parliament' s opinion in due form.
Question No 2 by (H-0819/00): Subject: Western Sahara On 13-15 September a delegation from the European Parliament' s Intergroup on Peace for the Sahrawi People, in which I participated, visited the Sahrawi refugee camps in South-Eastern Algeria.
Minurso has done remarkable work in identifying people with a view to drawing up electoral lists prior to the holding of the referendum on self-determination referred to in the UN Secretary-General' s settlement plan signed by the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front.
The delegation noted the terrible living conditions of the refugees.
The constant postponement of the referendum, and the failure of negotiations in Berlin on 28 September 2000, are raising serious concerns and engendering deep disappointment among the people.
Question No 3 by (H-0846/00): Subject: Referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara The talks under way between the international mediator, UN Secretary­General special envoy James Baker, and the parties in dispute over the holding of a referendum on self­determination for Western Sahara, are in a state of deadlock.
At the meeting held on 28 September in Berlin, the Moroccan authorities suggested that they might end their support for the peace plan for organisation of the referendum.
The Council seeks to help foster a climate of confidence between the parties involved and ensure that this is achieved.
Resolving the conflict in the Western Sahara will help bring stability to the Maghreb and aid its economic and social development.
Both parties have just been granted a new deadline of four months - by Resolution 1324 - to try and make some progress on both counts.
In addition to this, EUR 9 million if aid is being provided as of November 2000 for a period of eight months.
I myself have visited the camps at Tindouf where this extremely difficult situation has been going on for 25 years.
At the end of the meeting held in Berlin on 28 September 2000, as you will be aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Morocco made a speech in which he reasserted his willingness to do everything possible in order to find a sustainable and definitive solution.
Mr Rabat now seems to have realised that this proposal did not meet either the UN Secretary-General or his Special Envoy' s expectations, and that it should have formed the basis for seeking a just and definitive solution to the problem.
This is the message we have given our counterparts in Morocco.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I think the EU would have far more influence in the Maghreb if there were stronger links with the reform process in Morocco.
I can simply point out the fact that France and Germany - and here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - raised these questions during a bilateral summit in Vittel last week, where it was decided to form a working group in order to find a solution to the problem.
I asked what consultations took place between the Council, the French Presidency and the standing working group of experts.
I asked that question because just three weeks after the Council's expert group, the standing working group on the safe transport of radioactive materials, published a report in April 1998 giving a clean bill of health to the way nuclear wastes were transported, the transports were found to be contaminated, as the Minister very well knows.
Question No 5 by (H-0826/00): Subject: EU initiatives in dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan Recently, following many years of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan - which have resulted in devastating economic stagnation and severe damage to the social fabric of the two countries - there have been signs of reciprocal attempts at rapprochement to break the current deadlock between the two countries and embark on reconstruction.
According to the International Herald Tribune of 7 September 2000, the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Robert Kocharian and Heydar Aliyev respectively, have had at least 11 meetings with each other in recent times.
As you will be aware, the European Union supports the mediation efforts currently in progress with a view to finding a political solution to all of the conflicts in the region, on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity of the states concerned and an appropriate degree of autonomy.
The European Union remains convinced that the Minsk Group of the OSCE has a central role to play in finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in spite of the fact that the solutions put forward by this group in 1997 and 1998 were both rejected by Erevan and Baku.
The European Union is also using all of the instruments at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement to help improve relations between the two countries.
Thanks to the various opportunities for cooperation, it has been possible to establish regular political dialogue with the aim of facilitating exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
At the same time, the Union continues to provide substantial material aid to both countries through its various programmes, in particular its TACIS programme.
It has offered to finance cross-border projects of common interest in an attempt to re-establish good neighbourly relations between the two countries.
The commitment of the European Union has been publicly acknowledged by Armenia and Azerbaijan, who have both asserted their willingness to work towards a rapprochement between their countries and the European Union.
And a European Union which - from what I have read in the newspapers - recently changed its strategy on its energy problems and is now looking more towards the former Soviet Union - with all the implications which that has for the region in general - obviously cannot remain passive and fail to react to developments.
So from this point of view, and because, of course, the question was not asked in order to elicit an expression of satisfaction that everything is just fine but in order to express a concern, I think that it could be used as the starting point for an integrated policy, such as that which we have been debating recently for the Balkans; in other words, a new stability agreement for the Caucasus, at the political initiative of the European Union and with political objectives and priorities concerning development, autonomy and democracy in this region.
Mr President, I shall start by reiterating the question put by Mr Souladakis, i.e.
As the author is not present, Question No 6 lapses.
The European Council in Feira last June called upon the Council to speed up the implementation of measures combating illegal rings, provided for in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999.
The measures to which the author of the question refers comprise a draft Council Directive aimed at defining the concept of the facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence and a draft framework decision designed specifically to strengthen the penal framework combating the facilitation of unauthorised entry and illegal residence as defined therein.
These texts, which have been submitted to the European Parliament for consultation, are currently being examined by the relevant groups within the Council.
The question raised therefore provides the Presidency-in-Office with an opportunity to clarify several points.
I should also like to add that these two texts focus, in particular, on strengthening the framework of criminal law in order to fight organised rings of facilitators.
Question No 8 by (H-0836/00): Subject: 'Crimes of honour' in Turkey Every year, dozens of women fall victim to 'crimes of honour' in Turkey.
Such practices appear to be in sharp decline and, we are told, only occur sporadically in rural areas.
However, these crimes continue to be a source of concern for the Council as they are often committed in the most appalling circumstances.
The report that was adopted by the Turkish cabinet on 21 September as a reform programme contains several planned amendments to the law, such as the inclusion of measures in the Civil Code that are designed to enhance effective equality between men and women in social and educational fields, ways to better combat domestic violence by training judges that specialise in family matters and, lastly, measures to prevent people that have committed crimes of honour from serving reduced sentences.
Rest assured that the Council will remain particularly vigilant as to the implementation of these measures that are in line with the Copenhagen criteria, as discussed at length earlier on.
In any case, the issue of crimes of honour is not a problem that is specific to Turkey, as these crimes occur in many other places around the world.
The Council has therefore supported the Dutch initiative aimed at the introduction this year, within the framework of the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly, of a draft resolution against these crimes, which is still in the process of being examined.
My question to the Council is this: Are you prepared to make efforts to put a stop to the spiral of violence by, for example, demanding that Muslim leaders officially distance themselves from crimes of honour?
Question No 9 by (H-0839/00): Subject: Attitude of French European Affairs Minister, Pierre Moscovici, to Austria In an interview with the French TV channel France 3, the French European Affairs Minister, Pierre Moscovici, affirmed yet again his rejection of the Austrian Federal Government.
On the other hand, and speaking on a more personal level, I can confirm that the statements this Minister made on France 3 clearly reflect his personal opinion on the matter.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, it is clear from your reply that you personally are holding the Council to ransom.
It is precisely because the other 14 Member States disapproved that they imposed sanctions against it.
I should like to mention that the President of the Republic will be accompanied, as is usually the case, by one of his government ministers, either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or myself.
Next week, a meeting of the European Conference will take place on my invitation in France, in other words a meeting with the candidate countries.
My question to the President-in-Office is this: how is it that extreme right-wing parties are not banned in France and what is the President-in-Office's opinion of extreme left-wing parties in government?
If, for example, and here I am talking as a Minister, France was to elect an extreme right-wing party to office tomorrow, I would hope that the other countries would take measures against it similar to those taken against Austria.
I shall answer your first point very clearly.
In this regard, several countries, including Austria, have put forward proposals to amend Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, in order to set up a prevention and warning mechanism which would mean that a country considered to be out of step with the values of the European Union can receive recommendations while at the same time having its point of view heard.
As regards the other points, I have not used the words 'extreme left' and 'extreme right' here because this would run the risk of a debate on the definition of both notions.
As regards the Accession Partnership with Turkey to which you referred, the Commission put forward its proposals on 8 November at the same time as it submitted its report on the progress made by each of the 13 applicant States regarding their application for membership.
Secondly, how can the Council possibly accept a text in which the long-term objectives scarcely mention the Helsinki position on border disputes between a candidate country and a Member State of the European Union?
On the issue of minorities and, in particular, the Kurdish question, I think that anyone listening to the debate which took place earlier will be well aware that both the Commission and the Council are aware of these issues and have duly taken them into consideration.
I should like to remind you that this political dialogue constitutes, along with the future Accession Partnership, one of the elements in Turkey' s pre-accession strategy, which was set out on this occasion.
Next Monday' s General Affairs Council on 20 November will specifically debate the proposal for an Accession Partnership that the Commission has just put forward, which contains extremely clear, explicit, specific references to the Helsinki conclusions.
In other words, is it possible that this partnership will be furthered and that Turkey will join the European Union without ceasing to occupy Cyprus and removing its settlers from Cyprus?
I did not say that it is true that there is an imperialist regime in Turkey, but I did say that if the European Union accepted this rationale, in other words, the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union while it still occupied a large part of Cyprus, you cannot blame us for considering the European Union' s actions as imperialist.
As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses.
Even though it is difficult at present to envisage the final details of such an agreement, it seems clear that we need to establish a framework for cooperation and partnership in the area of fisheries that is broader than the previous agreement, and extend it to encompass all of the fisheries sector.
The agreement will also take into consideration the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and aid the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector.
Mr President, I am very grateful to the President of the Council for such a positive and to some extent optimistic and encouraging answer.
It must be remembered that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a simple fisheries agreement; as he knows, if this agreement were not reached, bearing in mind its significance, this fact might conceal a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is essential that the French Presidency should push hard along this home straight because Commissioner Fischler lacks the Mediterranean imagination needed to be able to secure an agreement.
He is less likely to succeed in something which is purely Mediterranean, than Pitres, a village up in the Alpujarra mountains in Granada, is in getting its own port, or even the expansion of its port.
In view of this situation, my question is whether the French Presidency, which does have the will and the imagination, will make it possible for us to achieve a fisheries agreement, which is now vital after eleven months of having our fleet tied up.
The Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries acts on behalf of all of the European Union, irrespective of whether he comes from the north, south, east or west.
Commissioner Fischler held several meetings with the highest authorities in Morocco.
Two technical meetings took place in Rabat on 25 July 2000 and in Brussels on 27 and 28 September 1999.
These meetings seem to have revived the negotiation process and led to another meeting with a Moroccan delegation on 30 October 2000, therefore very recently.
It is worth pointing out that the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, must make it possible to reinforce cooperation between Member States while at the same time reinforcing the protection of human rights.
The principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions presupposes the reciprocal confidence of Member States in their own criminal justice systems.
The European Union Member States have a shared commitment to the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the rule of law.
It is by remaining attentive to these values enshrined in the Treaty on European Union that the Council will continue its work in the area of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions.
Mr President, I have on my desk a document which was presented to one of my constituents in Longuenesse jail in the north of France three months after his first detention there on suspicion of a drugs offence.
These are citizens from Scotland where after 110 days of detention any person charged with an offence must either be brought to trial or released and never again charged with that offence.
Mr President, my point of order is that there remain twenty minutes of Question Time, there are very few Members in the House and there is no risk of exceeding time.
In this context, the Council attaches the greatest priority to pushing this work forward in the following areas: the promotion of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, the security of energy supplies and the diversification of energy sources.
The competent bodies of the Council are currently working on a proposal to promote electricity from this renewable energy sources with a view to an agreement being reached at the next Council meeting in December, provided the European Parliament has given its opinion in due time.
As to energy efficiency, the Commission presented an action plan during last May' s Council meeting.
Furthermore, in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union' s oil supply, the Commission indicated that, at the European Council of Göteborg, it was planning to present a plan to save energy and to promote the diversification of energy sources, which should help to boost energy efficiency, especially in buildings and transport.
As regards the security of energy supplies, the Commission is planning to present a Green Paper, in November 2000, on the future and place of the different energy sources in the context of improving the security of the energy supply of the European Union.
This communication will tackle both nuclear energy and renewable energies.
What is more, the Presidency has convened a conference on the security of supplies for 24 November 2000 in Paris.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I will not conceal from you that my question was designed first and foremost to elicit a list of projects and a calendar from you.
Some of my fellow Members have suggested an idea, which I too endorse, of investigating or drawing up plans towards, for example, a policy imposing the euro as the sole means of paying for oil in certain countries.
Question No 15 by (H-0858/00): Subject: New US bill enforcing embargo on Cuba A new bill being voted on in the USA has given rise to a storm of protest both in Cuba and in European.
The position of the European Union on the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States has not changed.
In the same vein, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo as part of the Third Commission of the General Assembly of the United Nations which met on 9 November 2000, we launched an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with international organisations defending human rights.
The European Union notes with satisfaction that Cuba has continued to be very active in various international and regional forums.
It also recognises that measures have been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate the country into the region economically.
Finally, it is with concern that the European Union takes note of the findings of the United Nations' agencies and programmes on the ground.
I recalled the very clear differences between the United States and Europe regarding the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States.
I noted with satisfaction, on behalf of the Council, that Cuba had continued to be very active in various international and regional forums.
I recognised that measures had been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate their country economically into the region and reaffirmed Europe' s willingness to be Cuba' s partner in this process.
Finally, I recalled that it was with concern that the European Union took note of the observations made by the United Nations' agencies and programmes on the ground and deplored the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affected the Cuban population.
This case has not, in any case, been brought up in the Council of the European Union.
More generally, issues relating to the settlement of the disputes between Greece and Turkey are included in the reinforced policy dialogue in the context of Turkey' s pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership the Commission has just proposed and which the French Presidency - as I can confirm - hopes will be adopted quickly.
Moreover, the Council is gratified that, at their meeting in Budapest on 31 October, the Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministers agreed to adopt confidence building measures in the context of NATO, and to do so bilaterally.
Fourthly and finally, does he not think that his reply is an encouragement to Turkey, a candidate country for membership of the European Union, to continue its present policy of contesting the sovereign rights of Greece, a member of the European Union and that he has therefore indirectly admitted that there are border disputes which must be resolved, as we have said, on the basis of international conventions?
That is the mandate the Council has given itself for the next phase in the examination of this candidacy, which has already been discussed at length and in detail today.
The sums budgeted for the Balkans should put us in mind, in terms of quality and quantity, of a new Marshall plan and should act as a springboard to a new beginning in the countries of the western Balkans.
Nor should we forget that the countries of the western Balkans are not third countries, they are candidate countries for membership of the European Union and we must treat them as such.
The exception is the Reconstruction Agency which has its headquarters in Thessaloniki and an operational centre in Kosovo.
Commissioner and the few honourable Members who have found their way here, I must, of course, start by congratulating the rapporteurs on their work and excellent cooperation, especially the rapporteur who is here in the House.
I think that the Commission and Council are also keen for us to work consistently with the means at our disposal over coming years to achieve these objectives.
The second issue which I would like to touch on concerns the strategy in the region.
We must look on this region as a region of Europe and not as a region of antagonism between the countries and the national policies of Europe or America.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for the excellent reports which they have tabled today.
The message sent by Parliament through these documents comes across loud and clear.
We must bear in mind that there is still a long way to go along the road to peace in the Balkans and that potential friction points still exist which could well set the whole process back again.
But this region, the most troubled region of Europe, has never held such hope as it does now.
The virtually despotic Croatian system has been replaced with a pro-West democratic system.
The vulnerable countries surrounding the remains of Yugoslavia have weathered the crisis, and, what is more, Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia have even made economic progress.
In the fine changes of balance currently governing the Balkan region, the responsibility of the European Union is great, enormous, and when we say the Union we mean the Member States but also the European and Parliament.
The European Commission must assume responsibility for the smooth running of these programmes, and this is the primary objective of the two reports which are to be put to the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the texts before us, the Commission and Parliament have put a figure of EUR 4 billion on the war damage caused by the NATO bombings in Serbia alone, excluding Kosovo, thereby indirectly admitting that they were to blame for some of the material war crimes.
I totally endorse all the objectives which he set out.
That summit is taking place in rather happier conditions than we perhaps imagined when the presidency first conceived of it.
These two proposals respond to two key Union priorities: providing assistance to southeastern Europe and providing it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible.
The European Councils of Lisbon and Feira underlined the importance that the Union gives to the integration of this region into the economic and political mainstream of Europe.
The return of democracy to Serbia, thanks to the determination and courage of the Serb people and the democratic forces there, offers the chance now of building prosperity across the whole region.
The reform of external assistance which the Commission adopted on 16 May demonstrates our determination to improve radically the speed, quality and visibility of external assistance.
The figures bear this out: 84% of the funds allocated for reconstruction under Obnova - in 1998 to 2000 EUR 444.5 million - had been committed by the end of October 2000.
Seventy percent of the funds committed had been contracted and 43% of the contracted funds had been paid.
We have achieved rapid results in Serbia too, where the Commission, in the space of just over four weeks, has drawn up an emergency assistance programme worth in total EUR 200 million.
Our reforms have started to bring results too in Bosnia, where the implementation of assistance, in terms of amounts contracted and disbursed has improved dramatically since our delegation in Sarajevo was reinforced last year and authority was delegated to it.
The results that have been achieved are extremely encouraging.
These are the results of which the European Parliament too can be proud.
It was the European Parliament that sounded the alarm about weak management in Bosnia.
It was Parliament which supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.
It was Parliament which insisted on a single regulatory framework for assistance to the region and it was Parliament, in its role as budgetary authority, which made sure that funds were made available for emergency assistance for Serbia, without delay.
That is the purpose of these two proposals.
And it also proposes simple decision arrangements for programmes run by the European Reconstruction Agency.
Let me take up a number of the broad points that have been raised by Parliament, first the role of the Commission and its financial responsibilities in relation to the running of the agency.
The Commission takes very seriously its responsibilities for the implementation of the Community budget.
In the same spirit we can accept the proposal to include a reference to the Feira European Council conclusions in the preamble to the regulation.
Parliament's resolution on the Commission's communication on the stabilisation and association process also deserves to be mentioned in the preamble.
To be clear: we can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording, of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, the first part of 11, the first part of 13, 16 partially, 17, 18, 19 partially and 20, 21, 24, 28 in the first part, 31 and partially 37.
The Commission's position on the overall sum we estimated was necessary for the region, the so-called financial reference amount and its compatibility with the financial perspectives, is well-known.
That may be regarded by some Members of some Councils as being a touch brutal in its assessment of the powers of the Council but it is entirely true.
We have to deal with finite budgets but I very much hope that the budget which is available for the external actions of the European Union reflects the political priorities of the European Union.
I should have thought, in particular, that the experience of the last two months has shown that the Commission's proposal on financing was not as eccentric as some people suggested at the time.
Our main aim is to clarify the role of the governing board.
According to the new regulation the Commission will be permitted to adopt programmes proposed by the Agency without having to consult the management committee.
Let me make it clear that responsibility for the formal adoption of the programmes remains with the Commission.
It is the Commission that decides on the desirability of these programmes; it is the Commission which is responsible for the implementation of the budget; it is the Commission which adopts the programmes.
A number of amendments seek to ensure that the Agency acts under the direct and sole responsibility of the Commission and thereby to ensure that the Commission is solely responsible for the Agency's management before the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF.
I would like to thank Parliament for the sensible and pragmatic way it has accepted the current structure of the Agency.
I know Parliament's views on this issue and the Commission will take these into account in the design of any future executive agencies.
The language regime is a further sensitive issue.
We can accept those amendments which are designed to remove the requirement for a further Council decision to extend the mandate of the Agency to the whole of the FRY.
I can accept, too, those amendments which refer to the General Affairs decision of 9 October, to cooperation with NGOs, to the restoration of civil society and the rule of law, to the payment for services provided by the Agency, to third parties, to the possibility of creating further operational centres, to the responsibility of the director for the implementation of the work programme and the structure of the Agency's budget.
This means that we can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording, of Amendment Nos 1, 2, 6, 8, 10 in part, 11, 37, 16, 27 and 33.
This concerns Amendments Nos 29 and 30.
Let me reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its hard work on these issues.
This proposal should allow us to take advantage of the new opportunity we have, to make a decisive contribution as the European Union to lasting peace and prosperity across the whole region.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.
Before reporting on the third ASEM summit and evaluating its results, let me briefly say a word about the ASEM process.
The challenge for the third summit in Seoul was to deepen the ASEM process both for governmental participants and for the broader public.
We outlined our goals for ASEM III in our working party, we discussed it with the European Parliament before the summit on two occasions in the ASEAN working party and in the plenary which resulted, I believe, in your resolution of 5 October, the aims of which we not only took into account, but also managed to achieve in most cases.
In addition to adopting three important documents, the leaders of the summit actively engaged in discussion of sensitive issues like human rights, the South China Sea, East Timor and Burma.
Leaders agreed to an expanded and updated Asia-Europe cooperation framework 2000 which forms the work programme for the coming decade.
The summit adopted the separate Seoul declaration for peace on the Korean peninsula, welcoming the inter-Korean summit in June, urging both sides to continue building on its success and underlining the importance of engaging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in multilateral dialogue.
Leaders also confirmed the preparation of voluntary annual reports on the status of efforts to overcome barriers to trade as identified under the trade facilitation action plan.
In the social and cultural field, leaders recognised the vital importance of better educational links with specific initiatives for promoting mutual awareness, including an enhancement of inter-university cooperation and electronic networking between schools.
In the related people-to-people field, the principle of opening the ASEM process to a larger segment of civil society was maintained, although the NGO initiative to establish a social forum could not be realised because of the resistance of certain Asian partners.
I am sure Parliament can see these results are in line with the resolution of 5 October which I mentioned earlier.
Finally, leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of contacts among parliamentarians as set out in the cooperation framework.
I think that reminded us in Europe of the important role that we have in Asia, not just in economic and trade terms, though it has to be said that one of the reasons for Asia's recovery has been that we have kept our word to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.
We have kept our word in economic and commercial matters which, among other things, encourages Asia to take us rather more seriously.
It is important to remember that we also have a political role in Asia, not just in our advocacy of democracy and good governance, but also in the contribution we can make in the Korean peninsula and elsewhere to stability and security for the future.
The ASEM process is an important one.
The process is developing and strengthening with time and I look forward to the next ASEM meeting in Denmark in a couple of years' time when I am sure we will be able to build on the progress already achieved.
Commissioner, first I agree with your reading that the ASEM process is hugely important.
I think that it is our job here in Parliament to follow up on what the European side generously included in the conclusions, namely cooperation between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the countries in Asia, following the first ASEM conference held in Strasbourg a few years ago.
What is more important is what was not adopted.
We could have done so much more in terms of financial stability, trade and investments, and infrastructure.
Things were said but they have not found their way into the projects that were agreed, not even in terms of the considerable reserve, for example, although this could easily have been done.
We find it incomprehensible that the secretariat for the fellowship programme is to be located in Seoul.
What we want to know is whether our Ministers have given ASEM due consideration.
The European Commission deserves our support because we are convinced it is going about things the right way.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The Commission' s communication confines itself to dealing with those aspects relating to the powers of the Community and Member States in tasks arising from their participation in those organisations.
It must, however, obey the same basic principles from a legal and institutional point of view.
In future the Commission must not confine itself to being a mere figurehead: it must unequivocally and specifically take up all aspects of the Community's participation in these regional organisations, representing it, monitoring the transmission and verification of data, participating in scientific fora, and in general guiding Community action, including monitoring the fishing carried out in the context of these organisations.
The monitoring of fisheries affects the jurisdiction of the Member States and hence to a certain extent the core of their sovereignty.
In view of the growing importance of the regional fisheries organisations (RFO), the European Union must fully exercise its powers in fisheries matters, but this raises a problem above all of human and material resources.
Similarly, if the Community is a contracting party in the RFOs, it must behave accordingly and perform the role required of it.
The implementation of this principle has financial implications and requires legal changes and, possibly, sacrificing a certain amount of sovereignty; but if a particular model of political integration is chosen the means must be provided for that model to be put into practice.
The rapporteur has understood their importance perfectly and has drawn up an excellent report, which highlights the real weakness of the communication.
Similarly, the Commission has the obligation not only to properly represent us in the international maritime sphere but also to take the initiative.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner.
The regional fisheries organisations and the Community's participation in them is an important issue.
Reform of the CFP will be critical but getting the right reforms will be even more important.
The fisheries management scheme would involve all interest groups in a particular region.
Regional fisheries organisations provided a role on an international scale and regional or zonal management can make the global become local.
Because Europe' s Member States are obsessed with disputes in Community waters, they forget, in practical terms, that fishing has a worldwide dimension, in terms of both the conservation of marine stocks and production and also the markets and the nature of the fleets.
As a result, some countries in the Union, such as Galicia, which I represent, are affected particularly badly by this situation and by the consequent lack of human and material resources afflicting the European Commission in its implementation of the common policy for regional fishing organisations.
We are backing the regional fisheries organisations; we are asking for more regional fisheries organisations and for the Commission to have more weight in them.
To support the United Nations position in both the 1982 Convention and the New York one, which has been mentioned here, we must maintain a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.
We are a budgetary authority and I believe we should fund this line, because in these organisations and in these waters we are staking a lot on the future of fisheries in the coming years.
It has also been the source of tremendous disagreement between the fishermen, on one hand, and the scientists, on the other.
That is why I believe there is a tremendous role for the Commission to play in going out there and encouraging the fishermen to come forward and cooperate with it and come forward with a solution that we can all agree to.
In exercising their sovereign rights as flag states, they must provide the necessary human, financial and material resources needed in order for the Community to meet its international obligations.
The Commission should concentrate on its own job, which is to monitor and coordinate the implementation of controls in the regional fisheries organisations by the Member States.
I should like to reiterate two fundamental points here.
That means that we shall have plenty of opportunity here next year to discuss these issues in depth.
The Commission has always spoken out here in favour of the rules for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission and has always adhered to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Between 1998 and 2000, production surged disproportionately, with an increase of 20 million head of pigs, reaching an annual total of 205 million pigs slaughtered in the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, under these conditions, the problem concerns less the future of production than the future of producers.
That is why, fully aware of the extent of the problem, on the basis of my report the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development introduced amendments to make this proposal more attractive and more effective.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Garot report on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat, I should like once again here to make clear reference to the shadow side of the report.
The report, which basically makes provision for a compensation fund for pigfarmers, and hence goes beyond the Commission proposal, was adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr President, the Commission proposal recognises that the pigmeat market in the European Union is subject to cyclical movements, with periods of balanced supply and satisfactory prices followed by periods of plentiful supply when prices plummet.
The result is the disappearance of family holdings, whose only solution is to close down or to move into what is known as integrated production, in other words production in which the producers lose their independence as farmers and join a business structure - such as distribution chains or supermarkets - which dictates production plans to them in exchange for a certain economic stability.
What the proposal calls a regulatory mechanism consists of authorising a Member State that so wishes to establish a fund financed by those producers who join it on a voluntary basis for a minimum of five years, on the undertaking that they do not increase their stock.
If subsidised by the EU, the regulatory fund proposed in Mr Garot' s report may well be of short-term benefit to small producers and help keep them artificially alive at the expense of larger and more productive producers who are, of course, the future for pigmeat production here in Europe.
This objective suits me fine and, as I say, if we had applied it in other organisations of the market, we would have a very different structure today.
Mr President, at a time when food safety is more than ever on the agenda and, above all, at a time when the entire meat industry in Europe is affected by mad cow disease, it is especially important that the reform of the COM in pigmeat is adopted without delay.
But this proposal would be totally inadequate if it was possible for Member States to reject these regulatory systems and if the reserves used to maintain revenues in a period of crisis were drawn solely from producer contributions, as this would lead to a two-speed production in pigmeat.
The current COM in pigmeat is extremely flimsy and much too hesitant.
This planned reform is the first remotely significant reform that the Commission has proposed since 1975.
The amendments introduced by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the instigation of Georges Garot, whom I must congratulate on his work, transforms this limited text into a wide-ranging one.
The participation of all Member States in this new system will be compulsory.
The participation of the Community budget is also essential since, without it, those joining one of these regulatory funds would simply be faced with constraints and the system would not be attractive at all.
That is why our rapporteur proposes that the European Union should make a greater commitment by co-financing the regulatory funds.
In this way, far from creating an exceptional system from the standpoint of international practice, with this flexible system of preventing and managing crises we would be moving, at reasonable cost, towards what is practised in certain third countries, such as the insurance-cum-income systems in force in the United States and Canada.
We therefore support the proposal by the Commission, as profoundly amended by the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and will be voting in favour of the Garot report.
This fund may be just the instrument to reduce pigfarmers' losses in times of crisis.
The pig crises in 1998 and 1999 demonstrate the inadequacy of instruments such as private stocking and the export refunds of the common organisation of the market in pigmeat at the time.
In my view, the basic principle of EU financing should apply to common organisations of the market, including the common organisation of the market in pigmeat.
The proposal makes provision for the fund to be set up by the Member States.
Mr President, first of all, it would be totally wrong of us to have come here tonight to either criticise the report or the Commission for coming forward with the proposal.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
I have extremely serious reservations as to whether it can help the pig farmer in either the short term or long term.
Co-financing is one aspect, but I have a horrible suspicion that would perhaps create an uneven playing field in many countries throughout the European Union.
I have to ask the Commissioner - because this is the one thing that might be useful for some of us - whether this proposal will be mandatory on the Member States?
When the price has been low then the family is not doing well.
It is a question of balance.
Let us look at how we can best support the industry in the longer-term.
The crises in the pig sector which, thank God, we have since overcome, were in fact what prompted the Commission proposal in the first place.
What we are discussing is an instrument to support farmers' incomes in times of crisis.
The Commission proposal gives Member States the choice of whether or not they wish to set up a fund, whereas the proposed amendment makes it compulsory for all Member States.
Then there is the question of including specialist breeders in the proposed system, as stated in proposed Amendments Nos 7 and 13.
The Commission cannot accept proposed Amendment No 16 because this amendment would interfere drastically with the freedom of decision of farmers who decide not to participate in the fund, in order to retain their freedom.
The planned reduction in production for each Member State depending on previous production sounds suspiciously like a quota regulation.
As far as adjusting aid on the basis of the number of animals is concerned, may I point out that the Commission proposal already makes provision for a legal basis for just such a procedure.
But the title reads "on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat".
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. (The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
